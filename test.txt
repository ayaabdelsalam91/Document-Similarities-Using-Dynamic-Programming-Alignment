comp.graphics	quicktime performance was re rumours about do ok with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime the effects of scaling and so on i thought i d do some more tests first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic the movie i had been using only had frames in it it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor i decided something a little longer would give closer to real world results for better or for worse i pulled out a copy of a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie there s a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized a portion of about seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only frames per second to give a total of frames i captured the raw footage at a resolution of pixels with the spigot card in my centris quarter size resolution from a pal source i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor keeping the fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled to resolution the other at resolution i used the default quality setting in premiere and specified a key frame every ten frames i then ran the movie through the same raw speed test program i used for the results i d been reporting earlier result a playback rate of over frames per second that s right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie just for fun i copied the movie to my external hard disk a quantum lp s and ran it from there this time the playback rate was only about frames per second obviously the mb internal hard disk also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors and tried playing back the movie scaled to size this time the playback speed was over fps clearly the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime in action not i d try my tests with quicktime but i don t think it s entirely compatible with my centris and system unscaled the playback rate for the movie was over fps the other thing i tried was saving versions of the movie with preferred playback rates greater than and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer ie with quicktime s normal synchronized playback a preferred rate of fps didn t work too well the playback was very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved fps with ease i can t believe that quicktime s synchronization code would add this much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system s task switching a preferred rate of fps seemed to work fine i couldn t see any evidence of stutter at fps i think i could see slight stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more lawrence d oliveiro fone computer services dept fax university of waikato electric mail ldo waikato ac nz hamilton new zealand s e gmt

for this stuff is digital halftoning robert ulichney mit press isbn but before you go off and start coding check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item below all of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b w conversion rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle the obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination this is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination instead loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source this method is quite general and can be used for any one to one d mapping not just rotation you can add anti aliasing by doing sub pixel sampling however there is a much faster method with antialising included which involves doing three shear operations the method was originally created for the im raster toolkit see below an implementation is also present in

understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel the basic objects are the same for all image formats this is not so for vector formats the basic objects circles ellipses drop shadowed pattern filled round cornered rectangles etc vary from one format to another except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a one to one conversion between vector formats there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp psc edu the contributor states that it runs on unix ms windows and possibly the mac a better more specific blurb would be most welcome on the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another as far as i know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to comp sources misc check the index on your nearest archive site a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to x bitmap for example some of the commercial postscript clones for pc s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer also the postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun s x news can be used to render to a file if you re clever but in general the answer is no however if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial gnu ghostscript from the fsf current version includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter it implements essentially all of postscript level and alot of display postscript and level how to get pixar films the various john lasseter pixar computer animated shorts are available

circle as a bezier or b spline curve the short answer is you can t unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle the approximation may look acceptable but it is sensitive to scale magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large if you want to do the job right consult the

will tell you how to use it note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon if the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges this idea is known in the trade as the jordan curve theorem see eric haines article in glassner s ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special cases another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon if the sum is pi the point is inside if the sum is the point is outside however this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly code for both methods plus

sci.crypt	estimating wiretap costs benefits would wiretap chip be cost effective by robin hanson draft april summary compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police so the proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part in three thousand to be cost effective background until now phones have happened to allow the existence of wiretaps detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line and over time law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to aid in criminal investigations however powerful new encryption technologies threaten this status quo by making possible truly private communication a small chip in each phone could soon make it literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical microphones at either end in order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap phone conversations the u s government announced on april that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special wiretap chip to be placed in future phones instead of the total privacy chips which have been under private development the same day at t announced it would use these chips in all its secure telephone products each chip would be created under government supervision when it would be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key periodically during each conversation the chip would broadcast its identifier and other info in a special law enforcement block law enforcement officers with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the indentifier from special trust agencies and could thereby listen in on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone to date most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its security the government won t disclose the encryption algorithm and many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it has claimed the track record of previous governments does not inspire confidence on this point however this paper will neglect these concerns and ask instead whether this new wiretap chip is a cost effective tool for police investigation that is which is a cheaper way for society to investigate crime force phone communications to support wiretaps or give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways or to put it another way would police agencies be willing to pay for each wiretap if they had to pay their share of the full social cost of forcing phones to support wiretaps to start to answer this question we might compare the current benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan and since current benefits are easier to estimate we begin there wiretap benefits is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available in that year wiretap installations were requested and no requests were denied this figure does not include wiretaps obtained with the consent of a party to the conversation arrests resulted from wiretaps started the same year arrests came from wiretaps in previous years and of arrests led to convictions of the wiretaps were for phones vs pagers email etc were regarding drug offenses and were requested by federal authorities each wiretap installation heard an average of calls of them incriminating among people and cost an average of extrapolating from the installations reporting costs mostly for labor thus a total of about million was spent on wiretaps to obtain about arrests at per arrest thus these arrests are at least four times more expensive than the per arrest figure one gets by dividing the billion spent by all police nationally by the total million non traffic arrests thus the million per year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police expenditures and if we divide this by the million phone access lines in the country we get about cents spent per year per phone line or about two cents a month in general we deter a given class of criminals through a combination of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted and some expected punishment level if convicted so the social value of having wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get the same criminal deterrence through other means if unable to wiretap a particular suspect s phone police might instead use hidden microphones or investigate that suspect in other ways or police might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps or we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime if we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be on average twice as expensive as wiretaps then the annual social benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level of two cents a month per phone line wiretap costs let us for the moment optimistically assume that the us government encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would have offered instead protecting our conversations from the spying ears of neighbors corporations and governments both foreign and domestic even so the need to support wiretaps would add many additional costs to build and maintain our communication system extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions increasing traffic by some unknown percentage a special process must be used to add encryption keys to chips while securely distributing these keys to special agencies which must be funded and monitored the chips themselves are designed by a military contractor whose design is to remain secret and are manufactured through a special process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart chips are now offered at the relatively high price of a peice in lots of private encryption systems not supporting wiretaps would require none of these extra costs perhaps most important government degree would at least partially replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to be represented encrypted and exchanged in our future phones it is widely believed that governments are less efficient than private enterprise in procuring products and standards though they may perhaps perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private standards how much less efficient is a matter of debate some say they pay twice as much while others might say only more currently a total of billion is spent as operating expenses of u s phone companies which comes out to about per month per access line if we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per month we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even as much as one part in then wiretaps are not cost effective and this doesn t even include extra costs phone owners pay because their encryption chips are more expensive of course most phones wouldn t have encryption chips for a while but the wiretap benefit per phone is still the same so this argument still applies conclusion given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the phone system and the value of wiretaps we can justify only the slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps when the only modification required was to allow investigators in to attach clips to phone wires wiretap support may have been reasonable but when we consider substantial modification the burden of proof is clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs would really be less than the benefits if consensus cannot be obtain on this cost benefit estimate a compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a rate of say five cents per month a tax payable to police agencies nationwide to compensate them for their loss

sci.med	re cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy heart access digex com g writes hi i ve just returned from a visit with my ob gyn and i have a few concerns that maybe y all can help me with i ve been seeing her every weeks for the past few months i m at week and during the last visits i ve gained to pounds every weeks she said this was unacceptable over any week period as it stands i ve thus far gained pounds also she says that though i m at weeks the baby s size is weeks i think she mentioned inches for the top of the fundus when i was weeks the baby s size was weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i ve had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway that s of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasn t eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i m still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i can t even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i m concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if i m not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if she s concerned about fat i m not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i can t seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained lbs during her pregnancy and she s taken it all off and hasn t had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like i m being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this non fat diet i would understand if she had said low fat diet since i m trying that anyway even if she said really low fat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a high fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation i m not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated i m truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and i ll end up having to eat constantly thus far i don t find any foods satisfying thanks g for one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if it changes anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your calories where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat it s hard to digest anyway for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area is the baby still coming up is it starting to push or rub under your ribs how tight are your clothes you shouldn t be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive tract try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive easier on your legs circulation as well you might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months when you are shortwaisted it s easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles if i had my second one to do over again i think i d have tried to loosen up since he didn t turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way especially if she s young but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy my first pregnancy was miserable during the second i had very little trouble some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby grain of salt here good luck jackie

too i want to know why the food industry wants to put msg in food some people think it enhances the flavor i personally don t think it helps the taste it makes me sick so i try to avoid it from dyer spdcc com steve dyer writes sez you such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go but they re not relevant to the matter at hand which is not to say that i favor its use in things like baby food a patently ridiculous use of the additive but we have no reason to believe that msg in the diet effects humans adversely well i know that msg effects me adversely maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that i like to try to avoid the stuff from kiran village com kiran wagle writes if you don t like additives then for godsake get off the net and learn to cook from scratch sheesh excuse me why can t people learn to cook from scratch on the net i ve gotten lots of recipes off the net that don t use additives if you like additives then get off the net and go to your local supermarket buy lots of packaged foods and you get off the net is it to cover up the fact that the recipes are not very good or the food is poor quality yes and you buy it says something about your taste eh i don t and what happens when the companies forced to submit to your silly notions go out of business because nobody wants to buy their overpriced bad food removing preservatives directly raises food costs by reducing shelf life hey i ll pay my hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more but does not have preservatives i choose to speak with my pocketbook in many ways from kiran village com kiran wagle you have a good point msg is commonly used in soups in bottled sauces in seasoning mixtures and in the coating on barbecue potato chips nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fried foods like fish and chicken etc ad naseum if msg is really the problem we should call this barbecue potato chip syndrome or maybe diner syndrome or the and other natural flavorings syndrome it s been a few years since i ve bought anything labelled with and other natural flavorings from kiran village com kiran wagle the reaction came the time the msg was in the food that was the only difference same restaurant same ingredients how do you know this in order to demonstrate your claim you would have had to supervise the preparation on both occasions perhaps they used msg both times and lied about it perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil and produced some bizarre toxin that you re allergic to well i had had similar reactions many times that was when i really started watching carefully reaction to doritos hey guess what s in there reaction to lawry s season salt guess what s in there i ll give you a hint i ve had enough problems with many many many different products with msg that i figured out one thing unless i plan on getting sick i won t eat the stuff without my seldane and did i ever learn to read labels please note that i am not saying you are making it up i am just trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it might seem which was why i started checking every time i got sick and every time i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food products and consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and most importantly it s enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proof that my incredibly frugal fiance didn t flinch when i literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg and he always flinches when there s waste but it was a simple explanation i won t eat this stuff i won t cook with this stuff so i can either throw it out or give it away from pattee ucsu colorado edu donna pattee my guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained msg probably lawry s seasoning salt i love the way that tastes i m not saying i never consume anything with msg i ve noticed that i have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chips will bother me if i also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the chinese restaurants the day before from kelley healthy uwaterloo ca catherine l kelley all that s needed now is that final step a double blind study done on humans there isn t even an ethical question about possible harm as this is a widely used and approved food additive but some say that only of the population has a problem with msg some say it s more like but let s say that it s how many people would have to be tested that would have a problem also i know i have a problem with it and i wouldn t volunteer for a test like thanks guys but i don t want to get sick also i m sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times if i have a cold i m much more susceptible to the reaction than when i m healthy as proven today when i m stuffy but for some silly reason i still gave in and decided to have the bbq chips from kiran village com kiran wagle because too many of you generic rhetorical you not you cathy go around calling this chinese restaurant syndrome thus suggesting to the people you complain to that you experience this only from chinese food msg is prevalent in a lot more things than chinese food thats why i suggested calling this diner syndrome cathy doesn t i haven t saved all my postings but i never called it chinese restaurant syndrome and i never stated i got it only from chinese food i just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold or not hold the msg i can t call up whoever makes doritos and ask them to make me one back of chips without msg on the other hand if one complains about potatoes from a mix or restaurant spice mixes i m going to believe them and if anyone says they got msg sick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party i m really going to believe them well i believe i mentioned that in an earlier post let s see you wrote this message at date apr but on date apr gmt i wrote has anyone had an msg reaction from something other than a chinese restaurant lots of times that s why it was so hard for me to pin down i would probably have been easier if i d only have the reaction in a certain type of restaurant but i ve had the reaction in chinese restaurants and greek restaurants and italian restaurants and steak places i can tell you when a steak joint uses accent to tenderize their meat oh and just in case anyone thinks i m prejudice against either chinese food

sci.med	perception of doctors and health care the following article by columnist mike royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public s perception of doctors and their salaries i hope some of you will find it as amusing as i did reprinted w o permission there s no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors salaries by mike royko tribune media services on a stupidity scale a recent poll about doctors earnings is right up there it almost scored a perfect brain dead it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called families usa the poll tells us that the majority of americans believe that doctors make too much money the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians those polled said oh about a year would be ok how generous how sporting how stupid why is this poll stupid because it is based on resentment and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns plus and get the same results since the majority of americans don t make those bucks they assume that those who do are stealing it from them maybe the berlin wall came down but don t kid yourself karl marx lives it s also stupid because it didn t ask key questions such as do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician if those polled said no they didn t know then they should have been disqualified if they gave the wrong answers they should have been dropped what good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don t know what it takes to become a doctor or maybe a question should have been phrased this way how much should a person earn if he or she must a get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to b be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work and maintain a average or better and c spend four more years of grinding study in medical school with the third and fourth years in clinical training working to hours a week and d spend another year as a low pay hard work intern and e put in another three to years of post graduate training depending on your specialty and f maybe wind up in debt after medical school and g then work an average of hours a week with many family doctors putting in hours or more until they retire or fall over as you have probably guessed by now i have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton and clinton and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake america s health care based on what doctors contribute to society they are far more useful than the power happy ego tripping program spewing social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what clinton s first budget is to frugality but propaganda works and as the stupid poll indicates many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs of course doctors are well compensated they should be americans now live longer than ever but who is responsible for our longevity lawyers congress or the guy flipping burgers in a mcdonald s and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of self indulgent lard butted tv gaping couch cabbages ah that is not something you heard president clinton or super spouse talk about during the campaign or since but instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain they might have been more honest if they had said let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have that problem is you my fellow american yes you eating too much and eating the wrong foods many of you guzzling too much hooch still puffing away at a pack getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure you and your habits not the doctors are the single biggest health problem in this country if anything it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do in fact i don t understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day so as your

worldwide aids statistics hicnet medical newsletter page i volume number april centers for disease control and prevention mmwr rates of cesarean delivery united states source mmwr date apr cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly million of the approximately million annual deliveries in the united states since table the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among reporting countries exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico this report presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdc s national hospital discharge survey nhds for and compares these data with previous years data on discharges from short stay nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since in the nhds conducted by cdc s national center for health statistics for medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of inpatients discharged from participating hospitals the cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the nhds sample of approximately women discharged after delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from national vital registration data therefore estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the nhds stated differences in this analysis are significant at the confidence level based on the two tailed t test with a critical value of in there were cesareans per deliveries the same rate as in and similar to rates during table the primary cesarean rate i e number of first cesareans per deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans for also was stable ranging from to in the cesarean rate in the south was significantly p higher than the rates for the west midwest and northeast rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to years than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than beds than in larger hospitals and for deliveries for which blue cross blue shield and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment table the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries since the early s the number and percentage of births to older women increased however if the age distribution of mothers in had remained the same as in the overall cesarean rate in would have been essentially the same as the observed based on the nhds of the approximately live births in an hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april estimated were by cesarean delivery of these an estimated births were repeat cesareans and were primary cesareans since approximately primary cesareans have been performed annually in of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally compared with in of all cesareans in were associated with a previous cesarean with dystocia i e failure of labor to progress with breech presentation with fetal distress and with all other specified complications the average hospital stay for all deliveries in was days in comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was days and for a repeat cesarean days nearly twice the duration for vbac deliveries days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs days in the average hospital stay for all deliveries was days for primary cesareans days for repeat cesareans days and for vbac and non vbac vaginal deliveries and days respectively reported by office of vital and health statistics systems national center for health statistics cdc editorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from through however the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth a national health objective for the year is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to or fewer per deliveries objective postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births moreover the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health care costs for example in the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were and respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes for physician fees and for hospital charges if the cesarean rate in had been the year objective instead of the number of cesarean births would have decreased by versus resulting in a savings of more than billion in physician fees and hospital charges despite the steady increase in vbac rates since several factors may impede progress toward the year national health objectives for cesarean delivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since of women who are offered a trial of labor could deliver vaginally a level already achieved by many hospitals trial of labor was routinely offered in of hospitals surveyed in the most recent year for which hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national data are available when the vbac rate according to nhds data was the year objective specifies a vbac rate of based on all women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peer review process other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of physician and hospital specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns which may be an important

stationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially and unpredictably during may the office of medical services department of state oms dos and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official u s personnel stationed in kampala uganda a review of the health records from the embassy health unit ehu in kampala indicated that cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june compared with two cases during the same period in ehu oms dos and cdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among u s embassy personnel this report summarizes the results of the investigation malaria blood smears from of the reported case patients were available for review by oms dos and cdc a case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for plasmodium sp of the persons were slide confirmed as having malaria a questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the ehu to obtain information about residence activities use of malaria chemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures i e using bednets and insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening of the persons eligible for the survey responded risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in kampala

the risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april all or most of the time than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets rr ci the risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening compared with those who rarely used repellent rr upper confidence limit risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening as a result of this investigation ehu staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens ehu staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide impregnated bednets

national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note in uganda the increase in malaria among u s personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub saharan africa the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria endemic areas preventive measures that are also important for short term travelers to such areas mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most other areas with chloroquine resistant p falciparum however in some areas e g thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness in africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in preventing infection with p falciparum is mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at mg per week over a year period the risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis e g psychosis and convulsions is low i e episodes per users while the risk for less severe adverse reactions e g dizziness gastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance e g southeast asia and africa in africa for persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative although less effective regimen chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention

greenspan and dr deborah greenspan of the department of stomatology school of dentistry university of california san francisco an international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance the conference drew more than scientists from countries including asia africa europe central america south america as well as the united states and canada support tor the workshop was provided by the national institute of dental research the national cancer institute the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the nih office of aids research and the procter and gamble company among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of hiv lesions ethics professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provision of oral care to the hiv positive population salivary hiv transmission and mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric hiv infection and women s issues recommendations recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv to establish a universal terminology for hiv associated oral lesions to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral lesions and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of hiv infection has hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april radically changed in hiv infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs today more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa a major increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis they also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progression and prognosis social political issues discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infection focused on changing the public s attitude that aids is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speakers also addressed health care delivery for hiv infected patients and the need to educate the public about what aids is and how it is acquired saliva and salivary glands conference speakers described transmission issues and the hiv inhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity they attributed the hiv inhibitory effect of saliva to the aggregation agglutination of hiv by saliva which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and direct effects on the virus or target cells other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hiv infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issues pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest with early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of hiv infected children has tripled the prevention of transmission of hiv from mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mother s sero status is known prior to giving birth periodontal and gingival tissue disease hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with hiv infection recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of diagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy occupational and treatment issues occupational issues surrounding the treatment of hiv infected individuals and treatment rendered by hiv infected health care professionals still command considerable attention factors under consideration include the cost benefit of hiv testing patient to health care provider transmission of hiv infection and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of hiv infected patients conference participants

administration for immediate release susan cruzan the food and drug administration today announced the approval of depo provera an injectable contraceptive drug the drug which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection the hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy it is more than percent effective this drug presents another long term effective option for women to prevent pregnancy said fda commissioner david a kessler m d as an injectable given once every three months depo provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose depo provera is available in mg single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection if a patient decides to become pregnant she discontinues the injections as with any such products fda advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of depo provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it depo provera s effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer the world health organization and health agencies in other countries u s clinical trials begun in also found depo provera effective as an injectable contraceptive the most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain in addition some patients may experience headache nervousness abdominal pain dizziness weakness or fatigue the drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding breast cancer or blood clots in the legs lungs or eyes the labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april recent data have also demonstrated that long term use may contribute to osteoporosis the manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect depo provera was developed in the s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries the upjohn company of kalamazoo mich which will market the drug under the name depo provera contraceptive injection first submitted it for approval in the united states in the s at that time animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast cancer worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer including breast cancer in humans to be minimal if any hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april new rules speed approval of drugs for life threatening illnesses p food and drug administration monica revelle the food and drug administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life threatening illnesses such as aids cancer and alzheimer s disease these final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible said hhs secretary louis w sullivan m d the effort to accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a long term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration these rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration to approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers they apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease are used the new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably established the drug s sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug s effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness one new drug zalcitabine also called ddc was approved june using a model of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of aids accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when fda determines that a drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan the new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous fda oversight said fda commissioner david a kessler m d while drug approval will be accomplished faster these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the postmarketing studies do not verify the drug s clinical benefit if there is new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective or if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal of the drug or biologic hicnet

rescue photoreceptor cells in animal tests baltimore md researchers at the university of california san francisco and regeneron pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq regn have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light sensing cells in the retina of the eye the degeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause of visual impairment this research published to in the december issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science pnas holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists it is estimated that million americans have severe vision loss due to age related macular degeneration and americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary disease that causes blindness in addition each year more than people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas the research was funded in part by the rp retinitis pigmentosa foundation fighting blindness regeneron pharmaceuticals and the national eye institute it was conducted by drs matthew m lavail kazuhiko unoki douglas yasurnura michael t matthes and roy h steinberg at ucsf arld dr c eorge yancoooulos regeneron s vice president for discovery regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from ucsf in the research described in the pnas a light damage model was used to assess the survival promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells the rods and cones of the retina after light exposure brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects other factors such as nerve growth factor ngf and insulin like growth factor igf were not effective in these experiments discussing the research dr jesse m cedarbaum regeneron s director of clinical research said bdnf s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age related macular degeneration one of the leading causes of vision impairment and for retinal detachment following detachment permanent vision loss may hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april result frorn the death of detached retinal cells it is possible that bdnf could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached surgically retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness it is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life stated jeanette s felix ph d director of science for the rp foundation fighting blindness in addition to the work described regeneron is developing bdnf in conjunction with aingen inc nasdaq amgn as a possible treatment for peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy motor neuron diseases parkinson s disease and alzheimer s disease by itself regeneron is testing cntf in patients with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosis commonly known as lou gehrig s disease regeneron pharlnaceuticals inc based in tarrytown new york is a leader in the discovery and

dec national institutes of health high fat high calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat these findings according to investigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels it shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator dr william e connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at oregon health sciences university over the past years dr connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico while simultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexicans number approximately and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua the tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing probably as a result coronary heart disease which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations is virtually non existent in their culture loosely translated the name tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of miles or more while kicking a machete carved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables the tara humaras also eat small amounts of game fish and eggs their food contains approximately percent of total calories as fat of which the majority percent is of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of mg dl low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels of mg dl and high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels of to mg dl all of those values are in the good low risk range according to the researchers elevated cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april disease hdl cholesterol is considered beneficial in previous studies the tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to high cholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldl cholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator maria teresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi food was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the investigators direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses regular measurements included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were fed their native diet for week followed by weeks of an affluent diet in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was percent of total calories this is the prototype of the holiday diet that many americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborates dr conners such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol saturation index or csi recently devised research dietitian sonja conner working with dr connor the csi is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet csi indicates the diet s potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl dr connor explains the tarahumaran diet averages a very low csi of dr connor s affluent diet used in the study ranks a csi of the experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before exposing subjects to the experimental diet the standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amounts of fat changes in dietary fat and or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet the framingham study for example did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat all subjects were already eating on a plateau dr connor says after weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rose percent hdl cholesterol increased by per cent and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little plasma triglyceride levels increased by percent and subjects averaged an pound gain in weight according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after days of affluent diet as after days hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations we think hdl cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic study in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increased fat intake to percent of the total calories we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased quite a bit in this study dr connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to americans because of their usual high fat intake dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than percent of total calories as fat less than mg of cholesterol and a csi around varying in accordance with caloric needs such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comments on recent suggestions that americans adopt a mediterranean style diet the original mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products we are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation the world health organization who is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development dr connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society s elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increases the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a society who would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well being rather than paying for unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high risk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united states is percent less than it was years ago so a lot has been accomplished we are

microgenesys are advantages rather than disadvantages write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesys in meriden conn moore et al says that gp in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the cd receptor and that this recombinant gp does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv virus does in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant gp in patients infected with hiv broadens hiv specific envelope directed immune responses including crossreactive antibodies to gp epitopes and cd and cd cytotoxic t cell responses volvovitz and smith claim that they never intended their gp molecule to be identical to the native protein antibody responses against native hiv proteins including the types described by moore et al exist in nearly all aids patients but do not prevent hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april progression of hiv disease in addition the binding of gp or gp antibody complexes to cd has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of cd cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection the absence of cd binding by the microgenesys gp vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature phase i studies have demonstrated stable cd counts stimulation of cytotoxic t cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune function based on these and other

analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their hiv to that of the dentist death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of years were examined in detail there were patients who had undergone procedures of whom were deceased an examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with hiv infection all of whom were either homosexuals or iv drug users the researchers were able to detect of the remaining patients and agreed to be tested hiv infection was reported in five of the patients including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease one patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist

information inc bethesda md april absence of hiv transmission from an infected orthopedic surgeon journal of the american medical association vol no p von reyn c fordham the risk of hiv transmission from an hiv positive surgeon to patient is extremely low provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universal infection control procedures write c fordham von reyn et al of the dartmouth hitchcock medical center in lebanon n h the researchers contacted former patients on whom an hiv positive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures between january and june the orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive for hiv a total of former patients underwent hiv testing representing percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during the year period patients were tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure all patients were found to be negative for hiv by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery the examination of aids case registries and vital records neglected to detect cases of hiv infection among former surgical patients the estimated cost of the initial patient notification and testing was with the single most expensive activity being counseling and testing this accounted for percent of the total expense the patient notification and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the planning and execution of the study notifying patients of the infected surgeon s hiv status is both disruptive and expensive and is not routinely recommended the researchers conclude investigation of potential hiv transmission to the patients of an hiv infected surgeon journal of the american medical association vol hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april no p smith rogers audrey et al the risk of hiv transmission during surgery is so remote that it will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple methodologically similar investigations writes audrey smith rogers et al of the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore md the researchers identified a total of persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between and and for whom the hiv positive surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon the aids case registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained among the patients were dead had no address had test results known and did not respond to the questionnaire no study patient name was found in reported aids case registries one newly detected hiv positive patient was determined to have been most probably infected in during a transfusion there was no hiv transmission in person hours of surgical exposure suggesting that hiv transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per person hours of surgical exposure the researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infection control guidelines over percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested and of those whose results were revealed only one person was found to be infected with hiv the study patient s infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in as a result there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hiv positive surgeon to any patient transpired the researchers conclude april drug concerns to share aids data new york times p c kolata gina a total of major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a highly unusual move to share aids drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing dr edward scolnick president of the merck research laboratory in rahway n j arranged the collaboration he said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting hiv than any drug used alone the researchers are hopeful that hiv when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time therefore several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing the new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new aids drugs an agreement like this will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way said scolnick he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws in creating the agreement merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups including act up dr daniel hoth director of the division on aids at the national institute of allergy and infectious disease said we re delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for aids related stories wall street journal p b philadelphia inquirer p a usa today p b the next step in aids treatment nature vol no p maddox john although azt was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of people infected with hiv the findings do not indicate that azt should not be administered in people with full blown aids writes columnist john maddox azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of t cell counts however a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should not be used early in the course of disease while the cd counts of the people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo the first three years of follow up have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to death were not significantly different at roughly percent the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv infected individuals and that cd cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aids in infected people but nothing is implied by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared there is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available it is much more alarming that the cd count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids concludes maddox infective and anti infective properties of breastmilk from hiv infected women lancet vol no p van de perre philippe et al a vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the igm type in the mother s body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of hiv from mother to child write philippe van de perre et al of the hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april national aids control program in kigali rwanda the researchers hypothesized that transmission of hiv through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells by deficiency of anti infective substances in breastmilk or both factors a total of hiv infected women were enrolled at delivery in kigali rwanda milk samples were collected days months and months post partum hiv igg secretory iga and igm were assayed by western blot for the latter two after removal of igg with protein g in the day and month samples the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers gag pol and env at days months and months post partum hiv specific igg was detected in percent percent and percent of breastmilk samples iga in percent percent and percent and igm in percent percent and percent in children who survived longer than months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mothers milk the presence of hiv infected cells in the milk days post partum was strongly predictive of hiv infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis the combination of hiv infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm response was the strongest predictor of infection igm and iga anti hiv in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of hiv the researchers conclude april firms to share aids research in global venture journal of commerce p a a total of fifteen u s and european pharmaceutical companies announced tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early stage aids research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight hiv infection and aids the companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of aids research on combination therapies since realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every individual aids drug edward scolnick president of merck co research laboratories led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together said participants in addition to merck the other companies involved in the inter company collaboration for aids drug development are bristol myers squibb co burroughs wellcome glaxo inc hoffman la roche eli lilly co pfizer inc smithkline beecham ab astra du pont merck syntex inc boehringer ingelheim miles inc and sigma tau the participants said that all companies involved in aids drug development they were aware of had joined the collaboration and that any company actively involved in hiv anti viral development may participate scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april and early clinical data the american foundation for aids research amfar was pleased with the news of the collaboration which it hopes will lead to the development of drug combinations that will reduce viral resistance related story financial times p guidance over hiv infected health care workers lancet vol no p horton richard the united kingdom s department of health recently followed the advice of aids experts that there is no scientific reason for routine hiv testing among health care workers following recent highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted hiv the department issued revised guidelines on the management of such cases dr kenneth calman chief medical officer said doctors dentists nurses and other health care workers have an ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to hiv infection including if appropriate diagnostic hiv testing he

the ahmadiyya movement in islam an international organi sation was found in in qadian india the founder of this movement hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad was proclaimed to be the promised reformer of this age as foretold in the scriptures of almost all major religions of the world he claimed to be the fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of jesus christ metaphorically the muslim mahdi and the promised messiah the claims of hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition which are often witnessed in the history of divine reformers even today this sect is being persecuted especial ly in some of the muslim regimes the right of ahmadi muslims to openly practice their religion and to define themselves as muslims has been severely restricted in many muslim countries the united nations human rights organizations such as amnesty international and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the

i agree with the exception that i don t preach ignoring our cultures the body as a whole must be unified the question is shall we be a melting pot boiling ourselves down to one legitimate expression or shall we be more like a stew maintaining the textural integrity of the expressed diversity while upholding the unity of thought it released all churches from the use of the latin mass unity to allow them to speak to the people in the common language diversity in revelation we see that in the first century church there was one congregation in each major city so there was one unified church now in each city there were people of different cultures naturally they formed something of a stew with different members having different heritages nevertheless they were one body they met together sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups in places such as the temple courts now in a particular city then and now you will find that there is a common language associated with that region for instance in rome latin was spoken in the united states today english is spoken so it would make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common language and not necessarily latin naturally you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language in the first century church there were probably many people in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the message for people of foreign ethnic groups today however you don t see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons even in so called pentacostal churches we do have a modern day equivalent though bi lingual speakers now in the unified church of which i am a member sometimes called the international churches of christ when we all meet together on sundays there are headphones on people who don t speak english from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue neat idea huh now we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on sundays so sometimes there will be a meeting of only haitians or of spanish speaking people for example who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language in addition we meet in small groups a couple of times during the week for bible discussion groups and devotionals so someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language assuming the congregation is large enough for those meetings as for the people who speak the common language they can keep in touch with their culture if they want but they will also have equally deep friendships among their church relationships with people of many various nationalities has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action the action of letting catholics worship in a native language instead of latin indeed not see my second paragraph in response to the second clipping of your article however if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a culture then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted i ll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping rather i believe it has been enhanced for paul exhorts us to become as one of them that we might reach them thus if a person or group of people feel more comfortable among their own shall we not give them a place where they can feel comfortable with their heritage and still l ove god my guess aaron you have met some needs of people certainly by helping them to be proud of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn t yet you have largely isolated yourselves from having quality christian friendships outside your nationality and your denomination we shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage however we will do this in a way that does not destroy church unity but rather encourages friendships among all disciples this is the approach of some of the groups that you cite it sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions but they are going about things in the wrong way and names like the african methodist episcopal church still make me cringe although not as much as before i understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such groups to be formed but now we should try to unite i know that it s hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one body of people on earth but it is quite possible and i am working to make it happen however what might be a smaller step towards unity would be taking the word african out of your denomination s name then perhaps someday a long time off you can also remove the methodist episcopal part also and simply be part of the church with regard to inclusivity i note tht your sig emits from mit as you know the tute is religiously and culturally diversified and not everyone who comes there is immediately comfortable with english much less american culture what shall be the conduct of the campus churches then shall there be one church for the sake of unity or shall the organizations like kcf be useful in helping students new to america make the transition in culture language and thought there shall be one church for the sake of unity and it shall be useful in helping students new to america make the transition in culture language and thought we shouldn t make a new denomination to try to solve problems the whole denominational mindset only causes more problems sadly in the ame church we retain african cutlure at the root of our expression but we are by no means exclusive since you live in cambridge i invite you to visit the local assembly there thank you for the invitation that shows me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of jesus as well as take part in your cultural heritage thank you also for responding to my post i know all too well how they can be very time consuming the whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions but i still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same time my own church the boston church has the acapella singing that you mentioned in your post yet doesn t limit expression of my mexican culture even though i am in the mit campus ministry and not the spanish speaking zone i have made a commitment to god that i will go to the sunday services of my church because i know that my brothers and sisters here are fully devoted in love for god as his disciples i don t believe in tongues as you may have already picked up on because of my understanding of biblical christianity however i am certainly willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesn t interfere with my normal worship since you also live in cambridge i also extend an invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like you can meet the mit students at the student center across from mass ave at am on sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after wednesday night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day my number is but will be in a few weeks from now and for the rest of the summer our service normally last from am to noon but occasionally are later or earlier times per year let us always strive to reach all with the gospel by any means necessary as we move from milk to meat the petty things of the world that temporally separate us will dissolve away and we shall stand with our naked

localised in upper italy and dated about the year it is the most ancient witness we possess as to the principal parts of the roman canon which only appear in the sacramentaries some time after the seventh century the question as to whether the roman canon is not older even than that of de sacramentis is discussed by liturgiologists mgr batiffol is of this opinion but we on the contrary think that the former bears traces of closer composition of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy and that consequently it is a text corrected from de sacramentis we shall see in studying the list of names in the memento of the living and that of the dead that mgr batiffol argues with good reason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of symmachus we thus have the state of the roman mass or at least of the chief parts of the canon at the beginning of the fourth century
soc.religion.christian	re why do people become atheists in article may athos rutgers edu fil sapienza med umich edu fil sapienza writes i am interested in finding out why people become atheists after having believed in some god god in conversing with them on other groups i ve often sensed anger or hostility though i don t mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile it does seem to be one motivation for giving up faith thus some atheism might result from broken ness i d like to field this one if i may although i am a believer in and follower of christ my experiences with religion haven t been all that positive in fact there was one point in my life when for about three days i simply couldn t believe in the existence of god anyway when i look back upon the troubles i ve had they seem to fall into two categories impulses to unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions and impulses to unbelief that resulted from frustration with god the first category doesn t occur to me much anymore as i have worked through most of the arguments for the non existence of god but way back when these would cause me some problems and i would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe i can see where others less stubborn than i and i do mean stubborn stubborness has often been the only thing standing between me an atheism from time to time would fail the second category arises out of some long term personal difficulties and the struggle to live my life as god would have me live it without living my life as others would tell me how god would have me live it a good example of this is my struggle with the more radical christians i meet i am not nor have i ever been on fire for chirst and i don t think i ever want to be nevertheless i am not lukewarm about my faith so i don t really fit in with the mainstream either quite naturally i feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within christian society and it can lead to a lot of internal tension when i want to do what i know is right but when another part of me believes that what i want to do is wrong because all the other christians think so to quite naturally this tension has a destructive effect on my relationship with god and during all of this internal strife there s atheism sitting there like the promised land no rules no responsibilities no need to live up to anyone s expectations but my own complete freedom of course it s all an illusion but nevertheless it s a very appealing illusion especially when the so called people of god are behaving like total twits i can easily understand why someone would go that route and would be hostile to ever coming back imho many of the former christians turned atheists who are now actively hostile to christianity are so because their experience with christ and god wasn t a very peaceful one but one of mind control and shut up and do what you re told because we know what s best for you because it s god s will and you re to young to know what god s will is yet courtesy of some of christ s more overzealous followers a final reason why people become atheists is because christians do not have a very good reputation right now one of the things that attracted people to christianity in the ancient days was the love that christians obviously had for one another and the world around them unlike the rest of the world christian communities actively cared for their poor and the christian rich did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers but bent down to help them christians were known for living exemplary lives even if they were thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn t sacrifice to the emporer nowadays courtesy of the media and some christian leaders who lost christ on their way to power people see christians as sexually repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of their own moral view there are a lot more reasons why people become atheists but i don t have time to go into them right now tom ault

soc.religion.christian	re serbian genocide work of god in article may athos rutgers edu db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler writes does he believe in predestination of course i believe in predestination it s a very biblical doctrine as romans shows among other passages furthermore the church has always taught predestination from the very beginning really you may be right but i d like proof as far as i know and i am not a div school student the catholic church does not seem to accept predestination my chaplain told me beware of greeks bearing gifts with reference to this doctrine it seems to have the curious result that human beings are not held responsible for their own actions i ll answer how you deal with this in a minute but to say that i believe in predestination does not mean i do not believe in free will men freely choose the course of their life which is also affected by the grace of god however unlike the calvinists and jansenists i hold that grace is resistable otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of god timothy right that doesn t really seem like predestination to me but i ll continue with what you re saying for god must give enough grace to all to be saved but only the elect who he foreknew are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance which guarantees heaven this does not mean that those without that grace can t be saved it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them knowing they would not need it as they had freely chosen hell this is really confusing to me especially since i still believe that christ jesus died for all of us preknowledge of obstinacy seems like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses but then i am not really biblically supported in this opinion or am i others people who are saved are saved by the grace of god and not by their own effort for it was god who disposed them to himself and predestined them to become saints but those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish thus they were deserving of god s punishment as they had rejected their creator and sinned against the working of the holy spirit so god uses grace like margarine he only spreads it where it s needed and not where it isn t and so there are the saved and the not saved and nothing in between hmmmm yes it is up to god to judge but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement well i would hold that as god most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done even if it was only a little for those he can t bless in the next life he blesses in this one although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause social problems it ends up doing just that if there is supposed to be some sort of sign that someone is elect like lots of children or success at work then those who have a good life on earth will go around thinking that those who don t are doomed to hell in a way though this sounds like the opposite idea those doomed to hell will have a great life on earth that s almost like the converse of what i believe responsibility for what we do now will be punished after we die you re saying what we get after we die has a direct bearing on how we live now strange and those he will not punish in the next life will be chastised in this one or in purgatory for their sins every sin incurs some temporal punishment thus god will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it cf samuel david s sin of adultery and murder were forgiven but he was still punished with the death of his child and i need not point out the idea of punishment because of god s judgement is quite prevelant in the bible sodom and gommorrah moses barred from the holy land the slaughter of the cannanites annias and saphira jerusalem in ad etc so sin is either punished now or later and not both what if it s sort of half punished are there any grey areas in this doctrine my stuff deleted we should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf proverbs but does that mean that christians should support a war in bosnia with the u s or even the u n involved i do not think so but i am an isolationist and disagree with foreign adventures in general but in the case of bosnia i frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved it would not be a just war blessed after all are the peacemakers was what our lord said not the interventionists our actions in bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us the idea well my idea would be that you would intervene to establish peace and stop the atrocities i m not suggesting wwiii i don t really understand what you mean by a just war of course i am not an isolationist although i see some merit in not jumping in at the first opportunity can you say kuwait we happen to be a big country with a lot of resources as well as a lot of debt and this

soc.religion.christian	re if there were no hell ofm comments the only problem with this is that jesus does use hell as a threat he doesn t sound like some of the more extreme fire and brimstone preachers and i don t think he wants people to live in abject fear but he talks a lot about people being found unworthy and mentions hell a number of times i agree that it might be more pleasant to think that it doesn t exist i certainly don t agree that god is some sort of sadist who tortures people forever but i am very much afraid that there really is a life and death spiritual struggle going on and that it is possible for people to lose in a serious way clh no disagreement at all that there is a very serious struggle going on but jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat that s quite different from hell classic tm jesus doesn t sound like the usual hell fire type of preacher he attracts people through what he does and the stongest example in jesus preaching is in the parable of lazarus and dives which is a parable in any case my point is that a fear based response to christ is not a freeing life affirming choice and isn t good news in a meaningful sense there are plenty of good reasons to follow jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal hell that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between god and the disloyal opposition a faith based in fear is not built on rock as we should found our faith but on ice if the fear were removed there would be no foundation that s basically why it matters to me i think we have many christians that don t have a solid basis for relating to the living incarnate god i cannot be fully open to the working of god in and through my life if my response to god is motivated on fear larry overacker llo shell com lawrence overacker shell oil company information center houston tx llo shell com

organpipe uug arizona edu maxwell c muir writes in all candor i would be happy to be proven wrong about believing in atheism problem is i will have to be proven wrong in mentioning some nonsense about psychology and atheism bob muir asks the following question no smiley on the part about atheism i see do you realize that your statement says that i was mentioning nonsense about atheism this is hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making as you have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the first please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it out of hand but because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of english i may be misinterpreting your wording here please clarify did you or did you not mean to call my statements about atheism nonsense if so care to back up that claim do i sound broken to you i answer in the affirmative ok then start up the amatuer psycology again how am i broken is it politically correct for christians to be the only besieged group permitted the luxury of arrogance yawn excuse me i don t recall any portion of my post in which i called christians arrogant quote me if i did i do remember calling christianity silly and then following that up with information that i was nine years old when i thought that i also said that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest and i would like to see some sort of proof of your god s existence i define faith as belief in the absense of any proof btw also i subscribe to a a as i mentioned and we see fundies of all types there so in answer to your question no finally i d hardly call christianity beseiged in this country i seldom see christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing crosses or having christian bumper stickers i don t know for sure of course i only say i haven t seen it happening what i have seen happening is my homosexual and or friends being beat up or preached at by people who claim to be christ s followers i know that this sort of thing isn t practiced by the majority of christians but it is a very vocal minority who are doing it and i don t see comperable victimization of christians now i have a question for bob why in the world would any self respecting atheist want to subscribe to a christian news group the implication being that i am not self respecting of course i m not a student of psychology btw but i am a student of creative writing and linguistics so literary analysis is my forte also if the implications i see are improper please let me know i m here because i m not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as you seem to think atheists should be did it occur to you that i don t think i know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life have you read my other posts here or did you see atheist and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn t deserve your respect aw geez i m sorry i probably am getting my back up a little too high here it s just that the nonsense thing really annoys me i figure you should see my first reactions though since they are my true reactions to your question now the smoothed feather version i seek all sorts of knowledge that s why i came to my university yes i am looking at your religion well sorta i have no idea what kind of christian you are from the outside and hopefully with an objective view i ve been trying to ask reasoned questions here because i genuinely don t know the answers to them but when i saw the question directed at atheists i figured i would answer after all you can speculate about atheist motives here all you want hence the amatuer psychology crack but without an atheist you can t be sure of even one atheist s motive i m hoping people really want to know and i was trying to show that i actually checked out several religions and i actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and i actually think about these things instead i m still faced with the implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only broken people are atheist try it from the flip side i posit that atheism is the natural state and only broken people are theists i offer as proof that so many people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they discovered their religion that religion is regional if people didn t follow the religion of their areas there would be a more homogenous mix so many terrorists claim theistic motives and that theists tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt atheism why are religions so successful because there is so much suffering in the world which breaks people it s an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it which is another reason i m here to try to see the flip side of my thinking and also as a watchdog for logical fallacies i have a difficult enough time keeping up with it and i think i know something about the subject the implication here being that atheists can t possibly know anything about christianity probably jumping at shadows again but i think my reaction is somewhat justified after all the first post suggested that atheists are broken hostile people this post confirms that someone else believes it bob reminds me of my roommate in order to disbelieve atheism he says he will need to be proven wrong about it well he got me there i am a strong atheist because i feel that lack of evidence especially about something like an omnipotent being implies lack of existence however i haven t met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him call me a seeker if you like i don t weak atheism is being ignore here though some atheists simply say i don t believe in any god rather than my position i believe that no god s exist for the weak atheist the is no atheism to disbelieve because they don t actively believe in atheism if you think this is confusing try figuring out the difference between protestants and methodists from an atheist point of view this is another fallacy many theists seem to have that everyone believes in something followed up by everyone has faith in something guess what my atheism ends the moment i m shown a proof of some god s existence is that really too much to ask well i don t even waste my time trying well i guess you won t succeed in converting him or me why the supposition that you will fail to convince him amatuer psycology on is it because you yourself are unconvinced i tell him that he ll just have to take my word for it and i told you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest note that i can only speak for myself if you find faith to be honest show me how i have been unable to reconcile it so far maybe that s how i m broken i tell you that i have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it if you accept that you are of a fundamentally different mind than i and i really would like to know how you think all i ask for is proof of the assertion god exists logical or physical proofs only please then we ll discuss the nature of god in response he tells me he will say an atheist s prayer for me prayer uh oh we ll have to revoke his

talk.politics.mideast	re deir yassin in article apr virginia edu rj s virginia edu get thee to a nunnery writes this is such bullshit deir yassin was an unprovoked attack on the part of the jews and a massacre defines it best in my opinion the village of deir yassin had had a pact with the jews a peace pact but the irgun purposely broke this agreement in order to scare off the palestinians i might grant that this village housed armed arabs i doubt it but nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that this was a motivating force amongst the irgun the deir yassin massacre was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the palestinians to flee the jewish homeland and contrary to your belief many civilians were killed deir yassin was later advertized by the very jews who perpetrated it because it was useful in getting many palestinians to leave the palestinians were rightfully scared off because they did not want another deir yassin i m not necessarily condemning the israelites here atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the arabs israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are and were the good guys in the middle east both arab and jew suck equally rj s you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the irgun to attack dir yassin was its strategic importance in fact begin who was in charge of the irgun wrote that dir yassin was attacked for its military significance dir yassin was merely a battle in the war of liberation people died but the thing was never intended to be a masacre that this hapenned is a tragedy of war not a crime of the irgun harry
