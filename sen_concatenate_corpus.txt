Whilst employment may be the European Union' s priority policy, fisheries, as another economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.	This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People' s Party.	That was changed in the face of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer: it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all, including British lorry drivers.

B5-0794/2000, Misters Medina Ortega, Linkohr and Fava, in the name of the Europeans Group of the European Socialist, on removal in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in the negotiations with the guerrilla;	Do you think that the “Austrian” model - namely decision making majority bilateral - will in the future constitute an instrument making it possible to make decisions by being unaware of the European institutions and to found a new institution, or a new group, to be able to circumvent the rule of unanimity within the Council?	If employment is the political priority of the Union, the fishing industry, as the economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.	In view of the criticism, especially those in Ireland and France, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a new interpretation: it is now a tax for all users, including the British lorry drivers.	This is the position defended by the rapporteur and by the popular Party.

Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy.	There is, of course, one crucial event, namely that a start has been made with category four and with looking at ways how we will deal with it, but it is not yet entirely clear whether we have managed to resolve this, partly because the Council refuses to have sufficient input in the attendant thought processes.	After all, it is by no means certain that the proposed definition of equitable price is better than any other, because the various definitions that are currently in use in the Member States are all perfectly satisfactory.

Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the different countries and for the EU as a whole - depends on the example of Denmark is for us to show - largely of the elimination of social and democratic deficits in European policy.	There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we have started category four, with his approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, particularly because the Council does not wish to participate in the discussion.	Indeed, it is not absolutely certain that the definition of fair price proposed is better than another, because the different definitions are currently used in the Member States are enough is enough.

As there is still a lot of uncertainty, we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken.	While withdrawing the resolution, however, I express the conviction that this Parliament would have made its voice heard better if, in anticipation of the Council of Nice, it had devoted a specific and separate resolution to these important and difficult topics of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of dealing with them in a single resolution that also embraces all the other points on the Council agenda.	Either we are in a club or we are out of it and it is particularly important that we accept this.	When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to apply the precautionary principle.	One could indeed wish for more and for improvement, but I honestly believe that we have made a good start.
We can indeed wish more and better, but I quite honestly believe that it is a good start.	Either we are part of the club, or we are not and we must therefore we bow to that decision.	By withdrawing our resolution, I nevertheless expresses the conviction that our Parliament would have done better its voice heard in devoting, in view of the Nice European Council, a specific and separate resolution to the issues so important and so difficult for the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than dealt with in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda for the Council.	We need to know today, since we are always in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures are to be taken.	When we are confronted with a potential risk, it is important to put the precautionary principle into practice.

Given this situation, there is an inescapable need for greater involvement and greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment.	That was changed in the face of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer: it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all, including British lorry drivers.	Lastly, and most controversially, the committee strongly called for the use of a fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.	Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite, and so, of course, we cannot vote for it.	There is an urgent need, following the recent attacks on the Greek minority in Himara, to promote democratisation measures and measures to strengthen institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.
Finally, and this is a controversial issue, the Commission has called with force to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.	Faced with the criticism, especially those in Ireland and France, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, gave a different interpretation: it is now a tax for all users, including the British drivers of heavy goods vehicles.	Unfortunately the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite and of course we cannot agree.	Faced with these realities, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.	The recent incidents against the Greek minority of Himara make more imperative the need to promote democratisation measures, of institution building and respect for the rights of the man in Albania.

And I am telling you loud and clear: Kostunica must be given his chance here and I therefore hope that he will give amnesty in the next couple of weeks or months, but meanwhile, I do want the introduction of those two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, to be accompanied by political conditions, both from a political and budgetary perspective.	Mr President, the Commission' s attitude to the right of access to documents may be seen from the internal handbook sent on 11 October to employees of the Commission to tell them how to deal with requests from MEPs for access to documents.	I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the eventual Treaty of Nice.	Clearly, explanations are necessary for the increased incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.	Slovakia has not been condemned to the second division and it is logical that it should like to join together with the Czech Republic.
Mr President, we cannot know the position of the Commission in the matter of public access to documents in reading the Commission has that has been postponed, on 11 October, the officials of the Commission in order to explain the way in which they had to deal with the requests in this regard access to documents.	And I say to you very clearly: we must give its chance Kostunica and I therefore hope that it will provide an amnesty during the weeks and months ahead; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, politically and in terms of the budget, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budgetary lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.	I have also voted against a text that calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty to be adopted in Nice.	It is obviously necessary to determine the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.	Slovakia is not condemned to remain in the second group and it is logical that it wishes to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.

All those who are at present engaged in illicit work would obtain work with decent social conditions.	I find it rather odd that people are already trying to tie the Commission's hands in relation to the proposal for a directive, while at the same calling on it to present a Green Paper on the current situation with regard to optional and supplementary health insurance schemes.	Mr President, I voted for the García-Margallo y Marfil report on the taxation of electronic commerce.	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution, which will, of course, be passed.	Without doubt, it was better to have no agreement at all than a poor one and it is true that, in this instance, the American proposal was a third-rate proposal, and one which was completely unacceptable to Europe.
All those who are currently working to obtain an undeclared employment in decent social conditions.	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the joint resolution that obviously we vote.	I find it a little strange to try to now force the Commission to a motion for a resolution and ask him in a same time to establish a Green Paper on the current state of voluntary insurance and health insurance complementary.	Undoubtedly, was it not to have an agreement better than to have an agreement which is bad and, in this case, the American proposal was a proposal with the reduction, completely unacceptable for Europe.	Mr President, I voted for the García-Margallo y Marfil report, which concerns the taxation of services provided by electronic means.

This is a vague area, and it is possible that more restrictive provisions may also remain in force, and this is one point in respect of which we have tabled amendments.	I should also have liked the Court of Auditors' report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter.	If we want to help Indonesia we must act now with money and deeds, not merely words.	Secondly, say no to the big bang idea of incorporating candidate countries simultaneously as a large group, since that would militate against the principle that each country should be admitted on its own merits.	On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, I would ask you, Madam President, to send Parliament' s condolences to the families of the victims and to the local authorities in both Brittany and in Marín, Galicia, from where the majority of the victims came.

Secondly, it is necessary to say “not” to the concept big-bang which would like that one admits at the same time an major group of country, because that would be in conflict with the principle of the admission of each country according to its merits.	The things are not clear on this point, and it is not impossible that can also remain in force more restrictive provisions. It is in particular on this point that we introduced amendments.

It must genuinely be a centre for coordinating the network of national agencies which, in turn, must activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions.

Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept which would be admitted that big bang, but at the same time, a large group of countries, because this would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country on its merits.

It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention.	I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything, which is why competition is not completely unrestricted, nor should it be.	The lesson for this Parliament this morning must be that we have to conclude that maritime laws throughout the world are in a state of shambles and we have to begin the process of putting them right.	This is our priority fight in order to ensure that the affirmation of fundamental rights is put into practice in our political decisions.	Those who stand apart from reinforced cooperation are really being given the same freedom as the back seat passengers in a car.
I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything and that, in this context, it is not or cannot be competitive without borders.	The lesson must retain this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the maritime laws are in the world, in a state of mess, and that we must get down to the task of up.	The most urgent task, which is, however, has not yet a lively interest on the part of the public.	Those who reject the enhanced cooperation have the same freedom of movement that passengers in the back seat of a car.	It is our priority for the assertion of fundamental rights is in political choices.

Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy.	(The sitting was suspended at 2.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	Clearly, explanations are necessary for the increased incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.	The labelling of beef that was agreed on, which is a minimum form of labelling and only came into force two and a half months ago, does not make it possible for the origin of animals to be adequately traced, and we were very slow to ban specified risk materials.	Mr President, we took a great deal of care over preparing the Karamanou report in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
It is obviously necessary to determine the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.	Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs has prepared very carefully the Karamanou report.	(The sitting was suspended at 14h06 and resumed at 3 p.m.)	Thirdly: the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the EU as a whole depend - the example of Denmark is here to show this - largely to the elimination of social and democratic deficits in European policy.	The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which entered into force for two and a half months, does not allow for properly tracing the origin of animals, and we have belatedly banned specified risk material.

I know that in France they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward.	Those who stand apart from reinforced cooperation are really being given the same freedom as the back seat passengers in a car.	As long ago as 1996 the European Parliament came out in favour of a ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal throughout the European Union in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only.	Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.	The French Presidency thanks you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for this cooperation, for your support and also for the warm reception you have given us.
For this cooperation, for your support and also for your reception, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, the French Presidency thanks you.	There is urgency and that is why we have decided to put this item on the agenda.	Those who reject reinforced cooperation enjoy the same freedom of movement that passengers back the seat of a car.	I know that in France, the principle of demolition of the whole herd was applied and that does not seem the best means of fighting this phenomenon.	From 1996, the European Parliament has declared itself in favour of a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - only if we had listened.

It is unlikely that the planned protection of the universal provision of services by means of a compensatory fund, as a result of which private profits are ploughed back into public services, will last.	As there is still a lot of uncertainty, we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken.	Knowledge of foreign languages is accepted as a necessary precursor to mobility.	The very worst situation is when the women concerned also come from distant countries, having taken the work on out of desperation because they have no other way of continuing to provide for themselves.	The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection.
Things are getting worse when it is a matter of women from distant countries which have accepted this work by necessity and which have no alternative to continue to provide for their vital needs.	The safeguarding of the universal service with compensation fund which would make it possible to initiate private profits for the benefit of the public service will probably failure.	The other point of view, illustrated by the original words of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and the codes of conduct needed to establish, between insurers, forms of mutual costs guaranteeing to all the provision of a good quality of care and to counter the risk of seeing develop discriminatory practices and a selection of risks and customers.	We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what are the measures to be taken.	It is recognised that the knowledge of foreign languages is a prerequisite for mobility.

The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection.	Question No 6 by (H-0886/00):	I should also have liked the Court of Auditors' report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter.	Slovakia has not been condemned to the second division and it is logical that it should like to join together with the Czech Republic.	We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality.
We have heard that the previous presidency has first restructured and then dismantled the Ministry of equal opportunities.

I would also have liked the report of the Court of Auditors fusse somewhat more user-friendly and he seen tabled a few clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations by chapter.	Slovakia is not condemned to remain in the second group and it is logical that she wants to adhere to the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.

While withdrawing the resolution, however, I express the conviction that this Parliament would have made its voice heard better if, in anticipation of the Council of Nice, it had devoted a specific and separate resolution to these important and difficult topics of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of dealing with them in a single resolution that also embraces all the other points on the Council agenda.	We welcome the arrangements proposed in this respect by the Preparatory Committee and adopted by the General Assembly regarding procedures for the registration of non-governmental organisations for involvement in the preparatory process and the Special Session in September 2001.	He will stand trial on 8 January on charges of having attended a meeting of the Tunisian opposition in France, which he denies.	We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality.	Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.
We welcome the measures proposed in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the General Assembly with regard to the system of accreditation of non-governmental organisations, with the preparatory process and the special session in September 2001.	We have heard that the previous presidency has restructured first and then dismantled the Ministry of equal opportunities.	There is urgency and that is why we decided to put this item on the agenda.	In withdrawing our resolution, I am, however, convinced that our Parliament would have made its voice heard in dedicating, in view of the Nice Council, a resolution and traditional so important and so difficult to the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than to deal in the framework of a single resolution including also all the other points of the agenda of the Council.	It happening in trial on 8 January. He is accused of having attended a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, which he denies.

The labelling of beef that was agreed on, which is a minimum form of labelling and only came into force two and a half months ago, does not make it possible for the origin of animals to be adequately traced, and we were very slow to ban specified risk materials.	I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive.	We welcome the arrangements proposed in this respect by the Preparatory Committee and adopted by the General Assembly regarding procedures for the registration of non-governmental organisations for involvement in the preparatory process and the Special Session in September 2001.	Firstly, simplification and clarification of the Treaties.	Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.

The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which has only been in force for two and a half months, does not make it possible to properly remind the origin of the animals and we banned very late specified risk material.	It is urgent and that is why we have decided to put this item on the agenda.

Do you think that the Austrian model, i.e. bilateral majority resolutions, will be used in future as a way of passing resolutions which bypass the European institutions and of forming a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent unanimity in the Council?	There is, of course, one crucial event, namely that a start has been made with category four and with looking at ways how we will deal with it, but it is not yet entirely clear whether we have managed to resolve this, partly because the Council refuses to have sufficient input in the attendant thought processes.	on the situation in Burma	The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.	Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we have begun the heading four, with its approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to resolve the problem, particularly because the Council does not wish to participate enough food for thought.	The right for a government to dismiss arbitrarily its constitution is the definition of a characteristic tyranny.	Approval of the official report of the previous sitting	On the situation in Burma.	Do you believe that the 'Austrian model' - namely the taking of bilateral majority decisions - in the future will be an instrument for taking decisions ignoring the European institutions and to build a new institution, or a new group, to be able to circumvent the rule of unanimity in the Council?

The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection.	It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention.	I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the eventual Treaty of Nice.	As long ago as 1996 the European Parliament came out in favour of a ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal throughout the European Union in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only.	Either we are in a club or we are out of it and it is particularly important that we accept this.
I have also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the future Treaty which will be adopted in Nice.	Since 1996, the European Parliament had decided in favour of a prohibition of the use of the bone meals in the European Union, in accordance with the precautionary principle - so only it had been listened to.	The most urgent task, which is, however, has not yet a lively interest on the part of the public.	The other point of view, illustrated by the original words of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and the codes of conduct needed to establish, between insurers, forms of mutual costs guaranteeing to all the provision of a good quality of care and to counter the risk of seeing develop discriminatory practices and a selection of risks and customers.	Either we are part of the club, or we are not and we must therefore abide by this decision.

Whilst employment may be the European Union' s priority policy, fisheries, as another economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.	I find it rather odd that people are already trying to tie the Commission's hands in relation to the proposal for a directive, while at the same calling on it to present a Green Paper on the current situation with regard to optional and supplementary health insurance schemes.	Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite, and so, of course, we cannot vote for it.	I know that in France they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward.	Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines.
Unfortunately the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be opposite and obviously we cannot support it.	I find a little strange to want as of now forcing the Commission with a motion for resolutions and to ask him in the same time to establish one Green Paper on the current state of the voluntary insurances and the complementary health insurances.	Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach of equality by gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.	I know that in France, the principle of slaughter of the whole herd has been applied, and that this does not seem to be the best way to combat this phenomenon.	If employment is the political priority of the Union, the fishing industry, as the economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.

Mr President, I would like to focus in my speech on Mrs Lalumière' s report, which I think is clearly worded and well put together.	- My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products, as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards.	The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.	Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.	That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even though we have used the flexibility instrument.
Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, which I think is well thought-out and clearly formulated.	That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by returning to Article 272; the financial perspectives have been maintained, even if we have used the flexibility instrument.	My Party to serious and about the rules of the sale of consumer products by means of the Community, just as it sets about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.	There is urgency and therefore we decided to put this point at the order of business.	The right to a government of arbitrarily its Constitution is the definition of a dictatorship.

This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People' s Party.	Slovakia has not been condemned to the second division and it is logical that it should like to join together with the Czech Republic.	Finally, I welcome the idea that we should review the implementation of the programme annually.	The UK Labour members of the PES Group welcome the adoption of their contribution to the ongoing work of the IGC on reinforced cooperation, without endorsing every single detail.	All those who are at present engaged in illicit work would obtain work with decent social conditions.
Slovakia is not doomed to remain in the second group, and it is logical that it wants to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic.	That is the position defended by the rapporteur and shared by the European People's Party.	- British Labour members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcome the welcomed contribution to the continuous work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without fully adhere to all the details of it.	Finally I welcome the idea of us to give an annual assessment of the implementation of the programme.	All those who are currently working on the black market to obtain an employment in decent social conditions.

Mr President, we took a great deal of care over preparing the Karamanou report in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	You do not even intend to incorporate it into the Treaty, evidence indeed that this text, this exercise was always destined to be laid aside.	As there is still a lot of uncertainty, we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken.	Firstly, simplification and clarification of the Treaties.	Whilst employment may be the European Union' s priority policy, fisheries, as another economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.
We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, which are the scientific data, which are the measures to be taken.	First of all, the simplification and clarification of the Treaties.	You do not even want to incorporate it into the Treaty, which shows that this text was to be put to one side.	If employment is the political priority of the Union, fishing, as an economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.	Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs has prepared with great care the Karamanou report.

The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rightly insists on no upper limit and a minimum of no less than 7%.	The resolution on Nice, voted today, does not reflect this.	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution, which will, of course, be passed.	Without doubt, it was better to have no agreement at all than a poor one and it is true that, in this instance, the American proposal was a third-rate proposal, and one which was completely unacceptable to Europe.	Above all, when a one-man company or a company with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it should not need to provide 120% loan guarantees in the form of land to receive financing; it should also be possible for it to be funded on the basis of a good idea.
Above all, when a company unipersonnelle or a society with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it must be possible to benefit from funding not only with a guaranteed to 120%, but also on the basis of a simple idea:	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the joint resolution that we shall, of course, be voting.	It is right that the Committee on Legal Affairs persists in refusing a ceiling and a minimum rate which cannot be below 7%.	Undoubtedly, was it not to have an agreement better than to have an agreement which is bad and, in this case, the American proposal was a proposal with the reduction, completely unacceptable for Europe.	The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been adopted, does not reflect.

Mr President, the Commission' s attitude to the right of access to documents may be seen from the internal handbook sent on 11 October to employees of the Commission to tell them how to deal with requests from MEPs for access to documents.	That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice.	It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention.	Spain has done a magnificent job in turning round the difficult neighbourly relations which Europe and North Africa and Spain and Morocco have suffered during the course of history.	I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything, which is why competition is not completely unrestricted, nor should it be.
It is a shame when it is thought that the European Union is posed as a champion modernization of the economic life!	Mr President, we can see the Commission's position in terms of public access to documents by reading the internal manual which was given on 11 October, with the Commission officials in order to explain the way in which they were to deal with the requests from the Members with regard to access to documents.	The most urgent task, which is, however, has not yet a lively interest on the part of the public.	I stress this point because the market cannot solve all and, in this sense, there cannot be any competition without limits.	Spain developed in a remarkably positive way the difficult vicinity which always existed between Europe and North Africa and between Spain and Morocco.

It must be respected and protected' .	Mr President, I would like to focus in my speech on Mrs Lalumière' s report, which I think is clearly worded and well put together.	We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality.	(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)	The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements.
Mr President, I shall concentrate in my speech on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, that I find well thought-out and clearly formulated.	(The House accepts the oral amendment)	The annual report is to identify such potential improvements.	We heard that the previous presidency initially restructured then dismantled the ministry for the equal opportunity.	It must be respected and protected.

I should like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear, comprehensive report.	The only instance in which no tax is levied is when the supplier is in a non-EU country and the recipient is in a Member State of the EU.	It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention.	And I am telling you loud and clear: Kostunica must be given his chance here and I therefore hope that he will give amnesty in the next couple of weeks or months, but meanwhile, I do want the introduction of those two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, to be accompanied by political conditions, both from a political and budgetary perspective.	Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.
I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.	The only case for which no tax is still perceived is that of a delivery in the European Community starting from a third country.	And I say this to you very clearly: we must give its opportunity to Kostunica and I therefore hope that it will ensure an amnesty during the weeks or months ahead; but in the meantime, I wish, however, that, in political terms and in budgetary terms, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budget lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction.	The most urgent task, which is, however, has not yet a lively interest on the part of the public.	The debate must be followed by concrete actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.

Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines.	I should also have liked the Court of Auditors' report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter.	One could indeed wish for more and for improvement, but I honestly believe that we have made a good start.	If we define a clear, binding framework for the Member States, then there should be a longer evaluation period for the various support systems required to satisfy these requirements.	Fifty-seven senators, including 24 Republicans, have signed the letter.
If we create a clear framework and binding on the Member States, the various systems to meet these requirements should have a longer period test.	I would also have liked the report of the Court of Auditors fusse somewhat more user-friendly and he seen tabled a few clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations by chapter.	We can indeed wish more and better, but I quite honestly believe that it is a good start.	Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar dedicated to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality by gender mainstreaming and specific guidelines.	Of those who signed the letter, 57 are senators, including 24 Republicans.

The European Council will also discuss the state of progress of the accession negotiations and hence of the enlargement.	Above all, when a one-man company or a company with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it should not need to provide 120% loan guarantees in the form of land to receive financing; it should also be possible for it to be funded on the basis of a good idea.	Thank you very much, Commissioner.	Reiterating the calls made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, what initiatives does the Presidency of the European Council propose to take with a view to playing a more active role so as to guarantee the full and complete application of the UN peace plan?	It is this kind of future I would also like to see in the other countries within the European Union.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	Above all, when a company unipersonnelle or a company with fewer than 250 employees is a project, it must be possible to receive financing not only with a guarantee to 120%, but also on the basis of a good idea.	The European Council will also discuss the State of progress of the negotiations on membership, and therefore of the '.	It is a development of this type which I hope in the other States of the European Union.	As the European Parliament has called for in its resolution of 16 March 2000, that they initiatives will the presidency of the European Council intend to take to play a more active role in order to ensure the full implementation of the UN peace plan?

The French Presidency thanks you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for this cooperation, for your support and also for the warm reception you have given us.	As a matter of urgency, therefore, the staff complement of the Interdepartmental Group attached to the Commission Secretariat should be strengthened at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure that all proposals for acts which are general in scope are accompanied, when considered by the College of Commissioners and on the basis of Article 299(2), by a simplified sheet outlining their potential impact.	Do you think that the Austrian model, i.e. bilateral majority resolutions, will be used in future as a way of passing resolutions which bypass the European institutions and of forming a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent unanimity in the Council?	I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive.	I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the eventual Treaty of Nice.
I urge the French Presidency to should do everything in its power to bridge the gap particularly destructive.	Do you think that the ‘ Austrian 'model – namely decision-making majority bilateral - will in future be an instrument for making it possible to take decisions by ignoring the European institutions and to establish a new institution, or a new group, to be able to get round the unanimity rule in the Council?	I also voted against a text which requires the incorporation of the Charter of the fundamental rights in the future treaty which will be adopted in Nice.	Thus, it is urgent that manpower of the Interdepartmental Group are very quickly reinforced with the cur of the General Secretariat of the Commission, so that all the proposals of act of general scope can be accompanied, during their examination by the college on basis of Article 299, paragraph 2, of a detailed impact statement.	For this cooperation, for your support and also for your warm welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency thank you.

If we define a clear, binding framework for the Member States, then there should be a longer evaluation period for the various support systems required to satisfy these requirements.	B5-0794/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;	That was changed in the face of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer: it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all, including British lorry drivers.	As there is still a lot of uncertainty, we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken.	on the situation in Burma
If we create a clear and binding framework for the Member States, the various systems have to meet these requirements should have a longer period of put to the test.	Vis-a-vis criticisms, particularly those of Ireland and France, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a new interpretation of it: it would be now about a tax for all the users, including the British drivers of heavy lorries.	(B5-0794 / 2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction by Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerrilla movement.	on the situation in Burma.	We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures are to be taken.

These objectives, the main one and the secondary ones, will be the touchstone by which the concrete proposals submitted by the Commission must be judged.	People with the same business affairs in common are peacefully bound to one another.	On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power.	I know that in France they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward.	Mr President, we took a great deal of care over preparing the Karamanou report in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies decreases by limit always more the right of veto and to give always more capacity to the Parliament of the EU.	These objectives, the primary objective and the secondary objectives, will represent the stone of hitting enabling us to judge the concrete proposals presented by the Commission.	The common economic activities create peaceful links between the people.	Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and we are to retain any prepared very carefully the Karamanou report.	I know that in France, the principle of slaughter of whole herd has been implemented and that this is not the best way to combat this phenomenon.

One could indeed wish for more and for improvement, but I honestly believe that we have made a good start.	The resolution on Nice, voted today, does not reflect this.	I think that France has set an excellent example by finally deciding to take this step.	In Nigeria, Chevron has been accused by the All-Ijaw indigenous people of instigating violence against them and actually paying Nigerian soldiers to shoot protesters at the Warri naval base.	It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention.
I think it is exemplary that France is resolved to take this step.	We can indeed wish more and better, but I quite honestly believe that it is a good start.	The most urgent task, which is, however, has not yet a lively interest on the part of the public.	The resolution on the Nice Summit, which has just been adopted, does not reflect it.	In Nigeria, the indigenous All-Ijaw accused Chevron to encourage violence against them and to go as far as to pay Nigerian soldiers to draw on the demonstrators in the naval base of Warri.

I know that in France they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward.	That made them heavily dependent on loans.	It is gratifying that Parliament has succeeded in producing a large majority in favour of more openness.	There is an urgent need, following the recent attacks on the Greek minority in Himara, to promote democratisation measures and measures to strengthen institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.	As there is still a lot of uncertainty, we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken.
I know that in France, the principle of slaughter of whole herd has been implemented and that this is not the best way to combat this phenomenon.	We must welcome the fact that Parliament has managed to gather a large majority in favour of greater transparency.	The recent incidents against the Greek minority of Himara make more imperative the need to promote democratisation measures, of institution building and respect for the rights of the man in Albania.	We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what are the measures to be taken.	A development which made them dependent on the borrowed capital.

Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.	You do not even intend to incorporate it into the Treaty, evidence indeed that this text, this exercise was always destined to be laid aside.	That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice.	The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection.	They will keep the pressure on, and they are strengthening their position with the revenue they are generating from delivering mail above 150 grams.
The other point of view, illustrated by the example of the original rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and codes of conduct needed to create, between insurers, the forms of mutual costs guaranteeing to all the provision of high-quality care and to counter the risk of seeing develop discriminatory practices and a risk selection and customers.	You do not want to even integrate it in the Treaty, which proves that this text was to be put on side.	The declarations must be followed concrete actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the products of the crime.	They continue to put pressure. The money they earn with distribution beyond the bounds of 150 grammes allows them to strengthen their position.	It is a disgrace when we think that the European Union raises champion of the modernisation of economic life!

Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite, and so, of course, we cannot vote for it.	The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rightly insists on no upper limit and a minimum of no less than 7%.	It is this kind of future I would also like to see in the other countries within the European Union.	As a matter of urgency, therefore, the staff complement of the Interdepartmental Group attached to the Commission Secretariat should be strengthened at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure that all proposals for acts which are general in scope are accompanied, when considered by the College of Commissioners and on the basis of Article 299(2), by a simplified sheet outlining their potential impact.	I think that France has set an excellent example by finally deciding to take this step.
This is a development of the kind that I wish the other States of the European Union.	I find that France exemplary committed itself to take this step.	It is right in saying that the Committee on Legal Affairs continues in the refusal of a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be less than 7%.	Unfortunately the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly opposite and obviously we cannot approve it.	Thus, it is urgent that manpower of the Interdepartmental Group are very quickly reinforced with the cur of the General Secretariat of the Commission, so that all the proposals of act of general scope can be accompanied, during their examination by the college on basis of Article 299, paragraph 2, of a detailed impact statement.

- My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products, as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards.	After all, it is by no means certain that the proposed definition of equitable price is better than any other, because the various definitions that are currently in use in the Member States are all perfectly satisfactory.	Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.	While withdrawing the resolution, however, I express the conviction that this Parliament would have made its voice heard better if, in anticipation of the Council of Nice, it had devoted a specific and separate resolution to these important and difficult topics of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of dealing with them in a single resolution that also embraces all the other points on the Council agenda.	Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.
By withdrawing our resolution, I am, however, convinced that Parliament would do better to devote its voice, in view of the Nice Council, a specific resolution separate and the extremely important subjects and difficult if the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than treating them within the framework of a single resolution including also all other items on the agenda of the Council.	There is urgency and that is why we decided to put this item on the agenda.	Indeed, it is not at all convinced that the definition of fair price which is proposed is better than another, because the different definitions used in the Member States are sufficient all amply.	The debate must be followed by concrete actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.	My Party to serious and about the rules of the sale of consumer products by means of the Community, just as it sets about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.

The French Presidency thanks you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for this cooperation, for your support and also for the warm reception you have given us.	The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection.	B5-0794/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;	The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.	Secondly, say no to the big bang idea of incorporating candidate countries simultaneously as a large group, since that would militate against the principle that each country should be admitted on its own merits.
For this cooperation, for your support and also for your warm welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency thank you.	Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept which would be admitted that big bang, but at the same time, a large group of countries, because this would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country on its merits.	The other point of view, illustrated by the rapporteur's original and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the rules and codes of conduct needed to build, between insurers, forms of degree of costs guaranteeing all the supply of good quality care and to counter the risks of discriminatory practices and a risk selection and customers.	(B5-0794 / 2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the abduction by Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerrilla movement.	The right for a government to draw aside its constitution arbitrarily is the definition characteristic of a tyranny.

Mr President, the Commission' s attitude to the right of access to documents may be seen from the internal handbook sent on 11 October to employees of the Commission to tell them how to deal with requests from MEPs for access to documents.	I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the eventual Treaty of Nice.	It is this kind of future I would also like to see in the other countries within the European Union.	The lesson for this Parliament this morning must be that we have to conclude that maritime laws throughout the world are in a state of shambles and we have to begin the process of putting them right.	That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even though we have used the flexibility instrument.
It is a development of this type which I hope in the other States of the European Union.	I also voted against a text which calls for the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty which will be adopted at Nice.	It is what we did: we avoided a budgetary crisis while returning in article 272; the financial perspectives were maintained, even if we used the flexibility instrument.	Mr President, we know the position of the Commission on public access to documents in reading the internal manual, which was submitted, on 11 October, the Commission's officials in order to explain the way in which they were to deal with the requests from the Members regarding access to documents.	The lesson for us within this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the laws at sea are, in the world, in a state of chaos, and that we must get down to work to bring order.

Lastly, and most controversially, the committee strongly called for the use of a fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.	Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.	Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines.	I know that in France they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward.	This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People' s Party.
There is urgency and that is why we have decided to put this issue on the agenda.	I know that in France, the principle of demolition of the whole herd was applied and that does not seem the best means of fighting this phenomenon.	Lastly, in a word, the fourth pillar dedicated to the equal opportunity consolidates the integrated approach of the equality by the gender mainstreaming and specific guiding lines.	This is the position defended by the rapporteur and shared by the European People's Party.	Finally, and this is something which is most controversial, the committee has called vehemently to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.

The European Council will also discuss the state of progress of the accession negotiations and hence of the enlargement.	I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything, which is why competition is not completely unrestricted, nor should it be.	Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite, and so, of course, we cannot vote for it.	Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.	At Feira, the Council considered those countries participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process as potential applicants for membership of the European Union.
Unfortunately the ultimate goal of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite and, of course, we cannot approve it.	It is urgent and that is why we have decided to put this item on the agenda.	I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything and that, in this context, it is not or cannot be competitive without borders.	The European Council will also be discussing the state of progress of accession negotiations, and therefore of enlargement.	In Feira, it has recognised the quality of potential candidates for accession to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process.

Firstly, simplification and clarification of the Treaties.	That made them heavily dependent on loans.	I should like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear, comprehensive report.	There is, of course, one crucial event, namely that a start has been made with category four and with looking at ways how we will deal with it, but it is not yet entirely clear whether we have managed to resolve this, partly because the Council refuses to have sufficient input in the attendant thought processes.	I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive.
Initially, that of a simplification and a clarification of the Treaties.	There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we have begun category four, with his approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, not least because the Council does not wish to participate in the discussion.	I appeal urgently to the French Presidency to do everything in its power to fulfil this particularly destructive gap.	I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report.	A development which made highly dependent on capital borrowed.

I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people, and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today.	Given this situation, there is an inescapable need for greater involvement and greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment.	While withdrawing the resolution, however, I express the conviction that this Parliament would have made its voice heard better if, in anticipation of the Council of Nice, it had devoted a specific and separate resolution to these important and difficult topics of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of dealing with them in a single resolution that also embraces all the other points on the Council agenda.	I think that France has set an excellent example by finally deciding to take this step.	On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, I would ask you, Madam President, to send Parliament' s condolences to the families of the victims and to the local authorities in both Brittany and in Marín, Galicia, from where the majority of the victims came.
I think it is exemplary that France is resolved to take that step.	Faced with these realities, the need for greater involvement and greater efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment is essential.	By withdrawing our resolution, I nevertheless expresses the conviction that our Parliament would have done better its voice heard in devoting, in view of the Nice European Council, a specific and separate resolution to the issues so important and so difficult for the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than dealt with in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda for the Council.	Madam President, I ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and on my own behalf, to send a message of condolence from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both Brittany that Marín, city of Galicia, where are from most of the victims.	I wonder if the Commissioner already provides the steps that will make it possible to show that we consider Koitunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with which the European Union will now address.

The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection.

The other point of view, illustrated by the original subject of the rapporteur and shared by many colleagues, is to promote the regulations and codes of conduct to be found, between insurers, the forms of mutual cost guarantee to all the supply of good quality care and to counter the risks to see developing discriminatory practices and a selection of risks and customers.	Finally, and this is a more controversial topic, the Committee has called with vigour to make use of the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.	The statements must be followed by specific actions to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.	The right for a government to dismiss arbitrarily its constitution is the definition of a characteristic tyranny.	It is urgent and it is for that reason that we have decided to put this item on the agenda.

Those who stand apart from reinforced cooperation are really being given the same freedom as the back seat passengers in a car.	This is no time for the faint-hearted.	He will stand trial on 8 January on charges of having attended a meeting of the Tunisian opposition in France, which he denies.	Do you think that the Austrian model, i.e. bilateral majority resolutions, will be used in future as a way of passing resolutions which bypass the European institutions and of forming a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent unanimity in the Council?	The lesson for this Parliament this morning must be that we have to conclude that maritime laws throughout the world are in a state of shambles and we have to begin the process of putting them right.
Those who deny the enhanced cooperation enjoy the same freedom of movement as passengers in the back seat of a car.	The lesson must retain this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the maritime laws are in the world, in a state of mess, and that we must get down to the task of up.	Do you believe that the 'Austrian model' - namely the taking of bilateral majority decisions - in the future will be an instrument for taking decisions ignoring the European institutions and to build a new institution, or a new group, to be able to circumvent the rule of unanimity in the Council?	It goes trial on 8 January of next year. It is accused of having participated in a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, as indeed it denies.	That is not the time to take hesitant.

Worst of all, I believe, is having to issue a warning that a court judgment in their favour may just be a set of comforting words and make no real difference in their lives.	That made them heavily dependent on loans.	After all, it is by no means certain that the proposed definition of equitable price is better than any other, because the various definitions that are currently in use in the Member States are all perfectly satisfactory.	It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention.	But I would like to say to Parliament this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact that the EU spends just 1% of GDP and much of that is administered in the Member States.
In my view, there is nothing worse than having to warn people that a judgment in their favour could only be a series of reassuring words and have no practical effect on their existence.	A development which made them dependent on the borrowed capital.	The most urgent task, which is, however, has not yet a lively interest on the part of the public.	Indeed, it is not absolutely certain that the definition of fair price proposed is better than another, because the different definitions are currently used in the Member States are enough is enough.	Nevertheless, I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of the GDP of the Member States and that the bulk of this money is managed in the Member States.

Mr President, I voted for the García-Margallo y Marfil report on the taxation of electronic commerce.	People with the same business affairs in common are peacefully bound to one another.	This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People' s Party.	This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People' s Party.	When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to apply the precautionary principle.
That is the position advocated by the rapporteur and supported by the European People's Party.	When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to put into practice the principle of precaution.	Mr President, I voted in favour of the Garcia-Margallo y Marfil report, which deals with the taxation of services provided electronically.	It is the position defended by the rapporteur and shared by the European People's Party.	The common economic activities create peaceful links between people.

Mr President, I would like to focus in my speech on Mrs Lalumière' s report, which I think is clearly worded and well put together.	I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people, and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today.	From the first discussions on this dossier, which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture, grounded in the highest standards of duty, respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime.	That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even though we have used the flexibility instrument.	When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to apply the precautionary principle.
When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to put into practice the principle of precaution.	It is what we did: we avoided a budgetary crisis while returning in article 272; the financial perspectives were maintained, even if we used the flexibility instrument.	Mr President, I shall concentrate in my speech on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, that I find well thought-out and clearly formulated.	I wonder whether the Commissioner already provides for steps to show that we consider Kostunica as the legally elected representative of the Serbian people and as a partner with which the European Union will now have to deal with.	Since the initial reflections on this issue, which took place at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed towards the Member States to promote action to develop what we could consider it as a police European culture, focused on the highest standards in the field of ethics, respect for the rights and freedoms of the people, and effectiveness in the fight against crime.

I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive.	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution, which will, of course, be passed.	Mr Gayssot, Greek ships have sunk without warning, when there were no storms in the vicinity.	- My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products, as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards.	When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to apply the precautionary principle.
My party issues serious reservations in connection with the regulation of the sales of products of consumption by the means of the community legislation, just like it issues reserves in connection with the concept of mutual recognition of the standards.	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak on the joint resolution that of course we will.	Ships Greeks have sunk, without that there are the slightest storm in the exist, Mr Gayssot.	I urge the French Presidency to should do everything in its power to bridge the gap particularly destructive.	When we are confronted with a potential risk, it is important to implement the precautionary principle.

That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even though we have used the flexibility instrument.	Firstly, simplification and clarification of the Treaties.	On the other hand, we would like to be given a chance to prove to Europe that we are able to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia on our own, by recognising the genuine principles of democracy.	The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.	We welcome the arrangements proposed in this respect by the Preparatory Committee and adopted by the General Assembly regarding procedures for the registration of non-governmental organisations for involvement in the preparatory process and the Special Session in September 2001.
Firstly, that of a simplification and clarification of the Treaties.	The right for a government to dismiss arbitrarily its constitution is the definition of a characteristic tyranny.	In addition, we would like to be likely to prove in Europe which we are able to develop only the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia, by recognizing the true democratic principles.	We welcome the proposed provisions in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the general meeting with regard to the method of accreditation of non-governmental organisations, the preparatory process and to the special session in September 2001.	It is what we did: we avoided a budgetary crisis while returning in article 272; the financial perspectives were maintained, even if we used the flexibility instrument.

On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power.	- My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products, as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards.	I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive.	You do not even intend to incorporate it into the Treaty, evidence indeed that this text, this exercise was always destined to be laid aside.	That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice.
I appeal urgently to the French Presidency to do everything in its power to fill that gap particularly destructive.	My Party expresses serious reservations about the regulation of the sale of consumer goods by means of Community legislation, as it makes reservations about the concept of mutual recognition of standards.	You do not want to even integrate it in the Treaty, which proves that this text was to be put on side.	It is a disgrace when we think that the European Union raises champion of the modernisation of economic life!	On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies fall into force by the further restriction of the right of veto and to increasing the power of Parliament to the EU.
