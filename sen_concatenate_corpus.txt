SMTeuroparl	An evolution which made them strongly dependent on the borrowed capital. Since the first thoughts on this issue, which were held at European level on the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission is committed to Member States to promote an action intended to develop what we could consider a European police culture, focused on the highest standards in terms of ethics, human rights and freedoms, and efficiency in the fight against crime. Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept which bang would admit that at the same time an important group of countries, because that would be at odds with the principle of the admission of each country on its merits. Slovakia is not doomed to remain in the second group, and it is logical that it wants to join the Union at the same time as the Czech Republic. Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept which would be admitted that big bang, but at the same time, a large group of countries, because this would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country on its merits.
SMTeuroparl	I think it is exemplary that France is resolved to take that step. There is an urgent need, following the recent attacks on the Greek minority in Himara, to promote democratisation measures and measures to strengthen institutions and respect for human rights in Albania. The Council of Europe, along with the Court of Human Rights, has a wealth of experience of such forms of supervision, and we can build on these. Without doubt, it was better to have no agreement at all than a poor one and it is true that, in this instance, the American proposal was a third-rate proposal, and one which was completely unacceptable to Europe. These objectives, the overarching objective and secondary objectives, represent the touchstone allowing us to judge the concrete proposals presented by the Commission.
SMTeuroparl	My Party expresses serious reservations about the regulation of the sale of consumer goods by means of Community legislation, as it makes reservations about the concept of mutual recognition of standards. Lastly, and most controversially, the committee strongly called for the use of a fast-track procedure to implement this legislation. If we want to help Indonesia, we must intervene with money and concrete actions, and not only with words. That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rightly insists on no upper limit and a minimum of no less than 7%.
SMTeuroparl	The lesson that must keep this Assembly in its debate of this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the maritime laws are, all over the world, in a State of mess, and that we should get down to the task to put in order. Mr President, I voted for the García-Margallo y Marfil report on the taxation of electronic commerce. The annual report is designed to identify such potential improvements. - My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products, as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards. Mr President, I voted for the García-Margallo y Marfil report on the taxation of electronic commerce.
SMTeuroparl	Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and internal affairs has prepared with great care the Karamanou report. I know that in France they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward. If employment is the political priority of the Union, the fishing industry, as the economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines. Those who deny the enhanced cooperation enjoy the same freedom of movement as passengers in the back seat of a car. The resolution on Nice, voted today, does not reflect this.
SMTeuroparl	We have started to exchange ideas on this question, from which it has emerged that all the Member States want to maintain this ceiling after enlargement. - My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products, as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards. My party issues serious reservations in connection with the regulation of the sales of products of consumption by the means of the community legislation, just like it issues reserves in connection with the concept of mutual recognition of the standards. Thank you very much, Commissioner. That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by returning to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even if we have used the flexibility instrument.
SMTeuroparl	I urge the French Presidency to do everything in its power to bridge this gap, particularly destructive. Secondly, we must say 'no' to the concept bang who would like to see the same time admit a large group of countries, because that would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country according to its merits. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rightly insists on no upper limit and a minimum of no less than 7%. Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda. Just as the European Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe has also considerable experience with regard to these forms of control; we can take as a basis.
SMTeuroparl	We started to have exchanges on this question, from where it arises that all the Member States wish the maintenance of this ceiling after widening. It is gratifying that Parliament has succeeded in producing a large majority in favour of more openness. It is gratifying that Parliament has succeeded in producing a large majority in favour of more openness. Mr President, we took a great deal of care over preparing the Karamanou report in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. I appeal urgently to the French Presidency to do everything in its power to fill that gap particularly destructive.
SMTeuroparl	One could indeed wish for more and for improvement, but I honestly believe that we have made a good start. And I am telling you loud and clear: Kostunica must be given his chance here and I therefore hope that he will give amnesty in the next couple of weeks or months, but meanwhile, I do want the introduction of those two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, to be accompanied by political conditions, both from a political and budgetary perspective. I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the eventual Treaty of Nice. The European Council will also discuss the progress of the negotiations of adhesion, and thus widening. That is the position advocated by the rapporteur and supported by the European People's Party.
SMTeuroparl	Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy. It is gratifying that Parliament has succeeded in producing a large majority in favour of more openness. The safeguarding of the universal service with compensation fund which would make it possible to initiate private profits for the benefit of the public service will probably failure. And I say to you very clearly: we must give its chance Kostunica and I therefore hope that it will provide an amnesty during the weeks and months ahead; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, politically and in terms of the budget, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budgetary lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction. Things are getting worse when it is a matter of women from distant countries which have accepted this work by necessity and which have no alternative to continue to provide for their vital needs.
SMTeuroparl	There is, of course, one crucial event, namely that a start has been made with category four and with looking at ways how we will deal with it, but it is not yet entirely clear whether we have managed to resolve this, partly because the Council refuses to have sufficient input in the attendant thought processes. Mr President, the Commission' s attitude to the right of access to documents may be seen from the internal handbook sent on 11 October to employees of the Commission to tell them how to deal with requests from MEPs for access to documents. That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even though we have used the flexibility instrument. I call on Prague to respond to this signal, this challenge, this plea for dialogue, to grant our request and to ensure, together with our House, that this legacy of a nationalist era can be consigned to the past. B5-0794/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;.
SMTeuroparl	The UK Labour Members of the PSE Group welcome the favourable response given to the contribution they have made to the continuing work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhering fully to all the details of this. Either we are in a club or we are out of it and it is particularly important that we accept this. On the other hand, we would like to be given a chance to prove to Europe that we are able to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia on our own, by recognising the genuine principles of democracy. The recent incidents against the Greek minority of Himara make more imperative the need to promote democratisation measures, of institution building and respect for the rights of the man in Albania. A step in the right direction, for which the European Parliament has been striving for a long time now, is the creation of a provisional unit for judicial cooperation.
SMTeuroparl	By withdrawing our resolution, I nevertheless expresses the conviction that our Parliament would have done better its voice heard in devoting, in view of the Nice European Council, a specific and separate resolution to the issues so important and so difficult for the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than dealt with in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda for the Council. By withdrawing our resolution, I am, however, convinced that Parliament would have done better by making its voice heard, in view of the Nice European Council, a separate and specific resolution on the issues which are so important and so difficult for the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than treating them in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda of the Council. Finally, and this is something which is most controversial, the committee has called vehemently to use the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation. Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy. The debate is closed.
SMTeuroparl	This rule can, moreover, apply to all drugs récréationnelles but dangerous provided that the consumer of drugs is the only run the risks. Nevertheless, I would like to say to the House this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the European Union spends only 1% of the GDP of the Member States and that the bulk of this money is managed in the Member States. Madam President, I ask you, on behalf of my colleagues of the Commission and on my own behalf, to send a message from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both of city of Galicia, where they are in the majority of victims. Reiterating the calls made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, what initiatives does the Presidency of the European Council propose to take with a view to playing a more active role so as to guarantee the full and complete application of the UN peace plan? I would also that the report of the Court of Auditors was that it had some clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations by chapter.
SMTeuroparl	- (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united continent of Europe. Worst of all, I believe, is having to issue a warning that a court judgment in their favour may just be a set of comforting words and make no real difference in their lives. By withdrawing our resolution, I am, however, convinced that Parliament would have done better by making its voice heard, in view of the Nice European Council, a separate and specific resolution on the issues which are so important and so difficult for the Intergovernmental Conference, rather than treating them in the context of a single resolution including also all the other items on the agenda of the Council. Without doubt, just better to have no agreement than having an agreement that is wrong and, in this case, the US proposal was a watered-down proposal, which is totally unacceptable for Europe. The very worst situation is when the women concerned also come from distant countries, having taken the work on out of desperation because they have no other way of continuing to provide for themselves.
SMTeuroparl	It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention. The recent incidents against the Greek imperative more the need to promote measures, of strengthening the institutions and the respect of human rights in Albania. (The meeting, stopped with 14:06, is taken again at 3 p.m.). . The British Labour Members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the support given to the contribution they have made to the work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhering fully to all the details of it. We need to know today, since we are always in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures are to be taken.
SMTeuroparl	I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people, and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today. B5-0794/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;.

Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and the EU as a whole dependent – the example of Denmark is there for us to show it – elimination on social and democratic deficits for European policy.
SMTeuroparl	As a matter of urgency, therefore, the staff complement of the Interdepartmental Group attached to the Commission Secretariat should be strengthened at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure that all proposals for acts which are general in scope are accompanied, when considered by the College of Commissioners and on the basis of Article 299(2), by a simplified sheet outlining their potential impact. This is a vague area, and it is possible that more restrictive provisions may also remain in force, and this is one point in respect of which we have tabled amendments. I should also have liked the Court of Auditors' report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter. Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite, and so, of course, we cannot vote for it. B5-0794/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;.
SMTeuroparl	The annual report is designed to identify such potential improvements. I think it is exemplary that France is resolved to take this step. We need to know today, since we are always in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what measures are to be taken. The European Council will also discuss the state of progress of the accession negotiations and hence of the enlargement. I have also voted against a text which asks for the incorporation of the Charter of fundamental rights in the future Treaty which will be adopted at Nice.
SMTeuroparl	Secondly, say no to the big bang idea of incorporating candidate countries simultaneously as a large group, since that would militate against the principle that each country should be admitted on its own merits. And I am telling you loud and clear: Kostunica must be given his chance here and I therefore hope that he will give amnesty in the next couple of weeks or months, but meanwhile, I do want the introduction of those two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, to be accompanied by political conditions, both from a political and budgetary perspective. When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to apply the precautionary principle. We have started to exchange ideas on this question, from which it has emerged that all the Member States want to maintain this ceiling after enlargement. Madam President, I would ask you, on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries and in my own name, to send a message of condolence on the part of Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of Brittany as Marín, city of Galicia, where originating from most of the victims.
SMTeuroparl	And I say this very clearly: it is necessary to give its chance to Kostunica and I hope that it will take time to a clear in the course of the coming weeks or months; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, in terms of policy and in terms of the budget, the political conditions are the introduction of these two new budget lines, namely the and reconstruction. On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power. Things are getting worse when it is a matter of women from distant countries which have accepted this work by necessity and which have no alternative to continue to provide for their vital needs. From the first discussions on this dossier, which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture, grounded in the highest standards of duty, respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime. We must clearly define the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.
SMTeuroparl	If we want to help Indonesia we must act now with money and deeds, not merely words. We must obviously determine the reasons for the increase in the incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States. I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future Treaty, which will be adopted in Nice. For this cooperation, for your support and for your kind welcome, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency thank you. This is a vague area, and it is possible that more restrictive provisions may also remain in force, and this is one point in respect of which we have tabled amendments.
SMTeuroparl	Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime. Do you think that the “Austrian” model - namely decision making majority bilateral - will in the future constitute an instrument making it possible to make decisions by being unaware of the European institutions and to found a new institution, or a new group, to be able to circumvent the rule of unanimity within the Council? There is an urgent need, following the recent attacks on the Greek minority in Himara, to promote democratisation measures and measures to strengthen institutions and respect for human rights in Albania. Reiterating the calls made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, what initiatives does the Presidency of the European Council propose to take with a view to playing a more active role so as to guarantee the full and complete application of the UN peace plan? I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive.
SMTeuroparl	Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda. Finally, and this is a more controversial topic, the Committee has called with vigour to make use of the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation. On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power. On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies fall into force by the further restriction of the right of veto and to increasing the power of Parliament to the EU. On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power.
SMTeuroparl	Mr President, I would like to focus in my speech on Mrs Lalumière' s report, which I think is clearly worded and well put together. The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements. The labelling of beef that was agreed on, which is a minimum form of labelling and only came into force two and a half months ago, does not make it possible for the origin of animals to be adequately traced, and we were very slow to ban specified risk materials. I should also have liked the Court of Auditors' report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter. I know that in France, the principle of slaughter of whole herd has been implemented and that this is not the best way to combat this phenomenon.
SMTeuroparl	The lesson for us within this House in its debate this morning is that we are forced to conclude that the laws at sea are, in the world, in a state of chaos, and that we must get down to work to bring order. The report aims to identify such improvements. And I say to you very clearly: we must give its chance Kostunica and I therefore hope that it will provide an amnesty during the weeks and months ahead; but in the meantime, I hope, however, that, politically and in terms of the budget, the political conditions are linked to the introduction of these two new budgetary lines, namely democratisation and reconstruction. We have heard that the previous presidency was first restructured then dismantled the Ministry of equal opportunities. Mr President, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and we are to retain any prepared very carefully the Karamanou report.
SMTeuroparl	We welcome the arrangements proposed in this respect by the Preparatory Committee and adopted by the General Assembly regarding procedures for the registration of non-governmental organisations for involvement in the preparatory process and the Special Session in September 2001. If we want to help Indonesia we must act now with money and deeds, not merely words. Madam President, I ask you, on behalf of my colleagues of the Commission and on my own behalf, to send a message from Parliament to the families of the victims and the local authorities of both of city of Galicia, where they are in the majority of victims. (Parliament accepted the oral amendment). We welcome the proposed provisions in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the general meeting with regard to the method of accreditation of non-governmental organisations, the preparatory process and to the special session in September 2001.
SMTeuroparl	It must genuinely be a centre for coordinating the network of national agencies which, in turn, must activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions. We have started to exchange ideas on this question, from which it has emerged that all the Member States want to maintain this ceiling after enlargement. If we want to help Indonesia, we must intervene with money and concrete actions, and not only with words. Firstly, the simplification and clarification of the Treaties. Do you think that the “Austrian” model - namely decision making majority bilateral - will in the future constitute an instrument making it possible to make decisions by being unaware of the European institutions and to found a new institution, or a new group, to be able to circumvent the rule of unanimity within the Council?

If employment is the political priority of the Union, fishing, as an economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines. Fifty-seven senators, including 24 Republicans, have signed the letter. We must be aware today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what are the measures to be taken.
SMTeuroparl	The European Council will discuss the state of progress of accession negotiations, and therefore of enlargement. Spain has done a magnificent job in turning round the difficult neighbourly relations which Europe and North Africa and Spain and Morocco have suffered during the course of history. The resolution about the Summit of Nice, which has just been voted, does not reflect it. I call on Prague to seize this sign, this invitation, this request for dialogue, to follow them up and to ensure that, together with this House, these relics of a nationalist era can be abandoned. The UK Labour Members of the PSE Group welcome the favourable response given to the contribution they have made to the continuing work of the IGC on closer cooperation, without adhering fully to all the details of this.
SMTeuroparl	We welcome the measures proposed in this respect by the preparatory committee and decided by the General Assembly with regard to the system of accreditation of non-governmental organisations, with the preparatory process and the special session in September 2001. This is our priority for the affirmation of fundamental rights to be implemented in political choices. It is rightly that the Legal Committee persists in the refusal of a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which cannot be lower than 7%. Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime. Undoubtedly, was it not to have an agreement better than to have an agreement which is bad and, in this case, the American proposal was a proposal with the reduction, completely unacceptable for Europe.
SMTeuroparl	The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements. In fact, it is by no means certain that the definition of fair prices which is being proposed is better than another, because the different definitions currently used in the Member States all are quite adequate. I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive. Therefore, I also believe that this reconciliation is sustainable, but that the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the university issue and to many other issues, needs visible signs of its success, and powerful support, else peace throughout the region will be under threat. on the situation in Burma.
SMTeuroparl	Mr President, I shall concentrate in my speech on the report by Mrs Lalumière report, that I find well thought-out and clearly formulated. Lastly, and most controversially, the committee strongly called for the use of a fast-track procedure to implement this legislation. Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy. On the situation in Burma. In Feira, he has recognised the quality of potential candidates for accession to the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process.
SMTeuroparl	On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power. He will stand trial on 8 January on charges of having attended a meeting of the Tunisian opposition in France, which he denies. We must be aware today, since we are still in uncertainty, what are the scientific data, what are the measures to be taken. Finally, and this is a more controversial topic, the Committee has called with vigour to make use of the fast-track procedure to implement this legislation. From the first discussions on this dossier, which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture, grounded in the highest standards of duty, respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime.
SMTeuroparl	Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting. From the first discussions on this dossier, which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture, grounded in the highest standards of duty, respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime. Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda. The task, which is important, however, did not arouse great interest on the part of the public yet. The debate is closed.
SMTeuroparl	The Council of Europe, along with the Court of Human Rights, has a wealth of experience of such forms of supervision, and we can build on these. Without doubt, worth it better not to have an agreement that will have an agreement that is wrong and, in this case, the American proposal was a watered-down proposal, unacceptable for Europe. Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda. Unfortunately the final objective of a European Constitution would be exactly the opposite course and we cannot approve it. Vis-a-vis these realities, the need for a greater implication and a greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and the underdevelopment is essential.
SMTeuroparl	Secondly, say no to the big bang idea of incorporating candidate countries simultaneously as a large group, since that would militate against the principle that each country should be admitted on its own merits. Knowledge of foreign languages is accepted as a necessary precursor to mobility. I would like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear and comprehensive report. Slovakia has not been condemned to the second division and it is logical that it should like to join together with the Czech Republic. Lastly, and most controversially, the committee strongly called for the use of a fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.
SMTeuroparl	If we define a clear, binding framework for the Member States, then there should be a longer evaluation period for the various support systems required to satisfy these requirements. From the first discussions on this dossier, which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture, grounded in the highest standards of duty, respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime. Do you think that the Austrian model, i.e. bilateral majority resolutions, will be used in future as a way of passing resolutions which bypass the European institutions and of forming a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent unanimity in the Council? The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny. As the Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe also has a solid experience with regard to such forms of control we can take it as a basis.
SMTeuroparl	The labelling of beef which has been decided, which is a minimum labelling and which has only been in force for two and a half months ago, does not make it possible to trace the origin of animals properly very late and have banned the specified risk material. question nº 6 of (H-0886/00):. A budget line has programmes for mine clearance and prevention for years. I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive. Undoubtedly, was it not to have an agreement better than to have an agreement which is bad and, in this case, the American proposal was a proposal with the reduction, completely unacceptable for Europe.
SMTeuroparl	Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy. If employment is the political priority of the Union, the fishing industry, as the economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines. I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people, and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today. Indeed, there is absolutely no doubt that the definition of fair price that is proposed is better than another, because the definitions used in the Member States currently sufficient all amply. There is, of course, a very important point is the fact that we have started category four, with his approach, but we do not yet know very well if we managed to solve the problem, particularly because the Council does not wish to participate in the discussion.
SMTeuroparl	That was changed in the face of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer: it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all, including British lorry drivers. We have started to have exchanges on this issue, where it emerges that all the Member States want the maintenance of this ceiling after enlargement. The resolution on Nice, voted today, does not reflect this. If we want to help Indonesia, we must speak now with money and concrete action, and not just with words. I should also have liked the Court of Auditors' report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter.
SMTeuroparl	In fact, it is by no means certain that the definition of fair prices which is being proposed is better than another, because the different definitions currently used in the Member States all are quite adequate. Either we part of the club, or we are not, and we must therefore we bow to this decision. Slovakia has not been condemned to the second division and it is logical that it should like to join together with the Czech Republic. I invite Prague to seize this sign, this invitation, this request for dialogue, to follow up and to ensure that, together with this House, these reliques an era nationalist may be abandoned. The annual report aims to identify potential such improvements.
SMTeuroparl	This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People' s Party. In my view, there is, however, nothing worse than having to warn people that a ruling for them could only be a series of words pleasing and have no practical effect on their existence. Fifty-seven senators, including 24 Republicans, have signed the letter. In my view, there is nothing worse than having to warn people that a judgment in their favour could only be a series of reassuring words and have no practical effect on their existence. Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.
SMTeuroparl	Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting. The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection. Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy. Secondly, say no to the big bang idea of incorporating candidate countries simultaneously as a large group, since that would militate against the principle that each country should be admitted on its own merits. It happening in trial on 8 January. He is accused of having attended a meeting of Tunisian opponents in France, which he denies.
SMTeuroparl	We shall talk with one voice disgracieuse within the WTO. A step in the right direction, for which the European Parliament has been striving for a long time now, is the creation of a provisional unit for judicial cooperation. Do you think that the Austrian model, i.e. bilateral majority resolutions, will be used in future as a way of passing resolutions which bypass the European institutions and of forming a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent unanimity in the Council? This is our priority fight in order to ensure that the affirmation of fundamental rights is put into practice in our political decisions. The UK Labour members of the PES Group welcome the adoption of their contribution to the ongoing work of the IGC on reinforced cooperation, without endorsing every single detail.
SMTeuroparl	Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on the report by Mrs LalumiÃšre report, which I think is well thought-out and clearly formulated. Those who stand apart from reinforced cooperation are really being given the same freedom as the back seat passengers in a car. Indeed, it is not at all convinced that the definition of fair price which is proposed is better than another, because the different definitions used in the Member States are sufficient all amply. Firstly, simplification and clarification of the Treaties. Thirdly, the acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the various countries and for the whole of the EU depend - the example of Denmark is here to show this - largely to the elimination of social and democratic deficits of European policy.
SMTeuroparl	We need to know today, since we are still in uncertainty, which are the scientific data, which are the measures to be taken. Question No 6 by (H-0886/00):. I would also have liked to see the report of the Court of Auditors was a little more user-friendly and that he had tabled a number of clear recommendations, for example, one or two recommendations by chapter. It is recognised that the knowledge of foreign languages is a prerequisite for mobility. That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice.
SMTeuroparl	Without doubt, it was better to have no agreement at all than a poor one and it is true that, in this instance, the American proposal was a third-rate proposal, and one which was completely unacceptable to Europe. Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite, and so, of course, we cannot vote for it. Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines. I find exemplary that France will be resolved to take this step. We welcome the arrangements proposed in this respect by the Preparatory Committee and adopted by the General Assembly regarding procedures for the registration of non-governmental organisations for involvement in the preparatory process and the Special Session in September 2001.
SMTeuroparl	- My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products, as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards. The debate is closed. The safeguarding of the universal service with compensation fund which would make it possible to initiate private profits for the benefit of the public service will probably failure. It must be the true brain of coordination of the network of the national agencies which, in their turn, will have to activate and coordinate a network of centers of excellence of food safety at the regional level. All those who are currently working on the black would get jobs under decent social conditions.
SMTeuroparl	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution, which will, of course, be passed. I would have also wished that the report of the Court of Auditors was a little more convivial and that it had presented some clear recommendations - for example, one or two recommendations per chapter. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution, which will, of course, be passed. The lesson for this Parliament this morning must be that we have to conclude that maritime laws throughout the world are in a state of shambles and we have to begin the process of putting them right. . (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and unified European continent.
