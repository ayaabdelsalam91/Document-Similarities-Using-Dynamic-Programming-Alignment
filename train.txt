little in article mar relay nswc navy mil rchui nswc wo nswc navy mil raymond chui writes hello the real reality our agency started to express interest in virtual reality vr so far we do not know much about vr all we know about are the hollywood movies the terminater and lawnmover man we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and computer graphics world magazine unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects for both terminator and lawnmower man those are film quality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high end parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time frames per second we certainly want to know more about vr who are the leading companies agencies universities what machines support vr i e sgi sun hp bim etc it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from to newly rendered frames per second this is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations additionally the frame rate must be constant if the system renders frames per second at one point then frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in real time unix in general does not support real time operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multi processor systems to be able to support real time operation bypassing the usual unix process priority management schemes uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support real time operation not sun sparc not hp series systems not ibm rs not even sgi s uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real time operation due to their symmetric multi processing smp shared memory architecture from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real time multi sample anti aliasing of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine systems fully support these capabilities the anti aliasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment what kind of graphics languages are used with vr gl opengl phigs pex gks etc you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed

comp.graphics	virtual reality for x on the cheap hi everyone i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups announcing the release of multiverse multiverse is a multi user non immersive x windows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainment research features client server based model using berkeley sockets no limit to the number of users apart from performance generic clients customizable servers hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources multiple light sources ambient point and spot objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attached functionality client the client is built around a fast render loop basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user s viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the user s actions which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users the client is designed to be generic in other words you don t need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers this release of the client software supports the following functionality o hierarchical objects with associated addressing o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot o user interface panels o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates o mouse and keyboard input some people may be disappointed that this software doesn t support the powerglove as an input device this is not because it can t but because i don t have one this will however be one of the first enhancements server s this is where customization can take place the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers o transparent client management o client message handling this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects o server selectable extension installation what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialisers you want o event handler registration when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to current events supported init move change collide terminate o collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activated when a collision occurs this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose the following is all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this is where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobjects function this is where you load the world wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrunning the clients that s all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers i ve provided generic lines dactyl lines more complicated collision detection due to the stairs will probably be improved with future versions dogfight lines location this software is located at the following site ftp u washington edu directory pub virtual worlds file multiverse tar z futures client o texture mapping o more realistic rendering i e z buffering or similar gouraud shading o hmd support o etc etc server o physical modelling gravity friction etc o enhanced object management interaction o etc etc both o improved comms i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and i m not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe i ve certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powerglove and an hmd finally one major disclaimer this is totally amateur code by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide i cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code use it at your own risk disclaimer over of course if you love it i would like to here from you and anyone with positive contributions criticisms is also encouraged to contact me anyone who hates it dev null and if anyone wants to let me do this for a living you know where to write thanks robert robert acsc com

comp.graphics	re sgi sales practices was crimson was kubota announcement my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch manager we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot i m also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in and grew to include the d d d and d as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about years this was true of the motorola based series the pi the professional series the early d s the power series parallel systems individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every months to years these are the facts of life if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and i o and larger disk capacities if we don t we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today you can t wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if it s feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r based bit multiprocessor systems now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but i m just a little tired of getting boned in the process if that s happening it s becausing of misunderstandings or mis communication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base maybe it s because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we aren t entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations doesn t have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we can t be out buying new systems on a regular basis most sgi customers are onesy twosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we pre announced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous poster s words to fill a niche to compete with some other vendor i m going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time i look at it i m going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money since we re supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every years making a year old computer at least and probably generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so don t

comp.graphics	questions about plane eqn method of hidden surface removal what are the main advantages of this method i have seen it described and the algiorithm seems a little bit long i developed my own method which requires that the points be in a counter clockwise order and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method it uses few calculations however basically it is several comparisons the only disadvantage i see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand my method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise when looking at the back of something the points occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figuring out which way the points go you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a d polygon has anyone heard of this method before it is so simple i doubt i am the first to think of it libertarian atheist semi anarchal techno rat i define myself tsa cellar org

applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil exploration etc it is called hips and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images it has been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well as a huge user contributed library feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research system development and teaching it handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single frames programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line drawing manipulation digital image compression and transmission methods noise generation and image statistics computation over such image transformation programs have been developed as a result almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines new users become effective using hips on their first day hips features images that are self documenting each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix filters it comes complete with source code on line manual pages and on line documentation host configuration requirements originally developed at new york university hips now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available it runs under the unix operating system it is modular and flexible provides automatic documentation of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and microvax sun apollo masscomp ncr tower iris ibm at etc for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and adage ikonas image processors and the sun sun sun and sun i consoles we

general purpose packages i ve heard of besides what terramar has sips was written for aviris imagery i m not sure how general purpose it is you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification you can compute an image using selected components i ve used it on megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best speed you need an external dsp card it will work without it but large images take quite a while times as long to process that s a freebie if you want it my favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems inc idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like it handles the number crunching very well also personally i like doing the number crunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even excel on the mac if it s not too hairy then bringing it over to nih image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn t handle and the speed and ease of use compared to iraf was incredible by the way it s mostly astronomical image processing which i ve been doing this means image enhancement cleaning up bad lines pixels and some other traditional image processing routines then for example taking a

sensing image processing package many may think of grass as a geographic information system rather than an image processing package although it is reported to have significant image processing capabilities feature descriptions i use grass because it s public domain and can be obtained through the internet for free grass runs in unix and is written in c the source code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass integration you then compile the source code for your machine using scripts provided with grass i would recommend grass for someone who already has a workstation and is on a limited budget grass is not very user friendly compared to macintosh software a first review of overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose image enhancement routines fft kelly maurice at vexcel corp in boulder co is a primary user of grass this gentleman has used the

macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite data grass is public domain and can run on a high end pc under unix it is raster based has some image processing

intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations e g multiply channel by add channel and store as channel and god only knows what all else there s a lot i don t have and don t use these so can t say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry s ct t format would probably i haven t tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it s worth noting that the pci database file is designed to contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database i believe that on workstations the built in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third party display systems the name gould deanza seems to come to mind one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q q bus bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users i e those for whom a mac pc largely doesn t suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time it s probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam spectral analysis manager back in jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data pixels across by lines by bands a modified version has since been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer which uses much larger images spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement stretching spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering the original spam uses x or sunview to display the aviris version may require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame buffer i can refer you to people if you re interested pcw requires x for display map ii among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley clrview clrview is a dimensional visualization

specify your correct e mail address to reply to what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section b file size in bytes comments ship ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif converted to gif with ppmquant fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg cjpeg q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg cjpeg q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg cjpeg q jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg o cjpeg q optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality does not mean keep of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q saying q will produce a file two or three times as large as q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q is about right for compressing bit images but q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of to is about right q or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in

ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows john bradley s free xv version and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu or ftp cis upenn edu the file is called xv tar z where is the version number currently it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pub xv directory at upenn xv reduces all images to bits internally which means it s not a real good choice if you have a bit display you ll still get only bit color also you shouldn t use xv to convert full color images to jpeg because they ll get color quantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions and earlier be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v decoder while xloadimage is using a hacked over v the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version a is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg a zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm and max work windows and os do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshw a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic is reputed to do the right thing with hi color displays the independent jpeg group s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics jpeg zip or jpeg zip if you have a and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools gif jpg jpg gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you can t get bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi s proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics gif jpg zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics alch zip note about simtel the internet s key archive site for pc related programs is simtel full name wsmr simtel army mil simtel runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdos graphics at simtel that really means pd msdos graphics if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead a popular usa mirror site is oak oakland edu which keeps simtel files in eg pub msdos graphics if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel by e mail see informational postings in comp archives msdos announce to find out how if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel mirror is microsoft windows there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version is available from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows and or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop jview zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note above file msdos windows winjp zip this is a slow compatible version if you register you ll get the only version which is roughly faster colorview is another shareware entry this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop cview zip i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in full screen mode not in a window os the following files are available from

shareware macintosh most mac jpeg programs rely on apple s jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system or later if you re running system you must also install the bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx as of this file contains quicktime which is better than qt in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt mac users should keep in mind that quicktime s jpeg format pict jpeg is not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime on bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over x pixels on a typical mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter hqx requires system or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt stuff pictpixie hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format adobe photoshop version or later can read and write jfif format jpeg files use the jpeg plug in from the acquire menu you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it amiga most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga physik unizh ch there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try

the author john kortink nutterbrink wj enschede the netherlands price dutch guilders about or pounds there s also a commercial product called jpeg which provides jpeg read write functionality and

cambridge uk tel portable software for almost any system if none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in b you ll also need a viewer program if your display is bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm bit image files there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assisted product ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else s files b if you are looking for source code to work with free portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the

contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif jpg jpg gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings for more information about jpeg in general or the free

comp.graphics	re removing distortion from bitmapped drawings in article apr sctc com boebert sctc com earl boebert writes let s say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x y positions are known now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danon s excellent digitize program that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to x y and saves those values when you click the mouse upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretching contracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion in particular if i have three sets of points reference x y the known true values distortedreference x y the same points with known errors distorteddata x y other points with unknown errors what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via e mail assume locally smooth distortion compute the delaunay triangulation of your x y points this defines the set of neighbors for each point if your data are not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull consider deleting these edges now there are two goals a move the distorteddata x y to the reference x y b keep the length e as measured from the current x y s as close as possible to the digitizedlength e as measured using the digitized x y s for every point compute a displacement based on a and b for example a for x y points for which you know the reference x y you can move alpha reference x y current x y this will slowly move the distortedreference x y towards the reference x y b for all other points examine the current length of each edge for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the point alpha sumofedgedisplacements this will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh iterate until you are happy for example no point moves very much alpha and alpha need to be determined by experimentation consider how much you believe the reference x y i e do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you can t allow the convex hull to change and you can t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically re triangulating the points using the current positions but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for years i might go back and re triangulate on every iteration if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other point but first read up on linear solutions to the n body problem there are lots of papers in the last years of siggraph proceedings on springs constraints and energy calculations which are relevant the above method

comp.graphics	outlining of spline surface about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published solutions to it the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional i e only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space to draw the object we fit a cubic spline through the points each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve each spline has an equal number of segments we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface depth sort the triangles take each triangle in sorted order project onto a d pixmap draw and color the triangle take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color it is the edge coloring in step that is at the heart of the problem the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area thanks

comp.graphics	xv problems please note the newsgroups recent discussion about xv s problems were held in some newsgroup here is some text users of xv might find interesting i have added more to text to this collection article so read on even you so my articles a while ago i hope author of xv corrects those problems as best he can so fine program xv is that it is worth of improving i have also minor ideas for bit xv e mail me for them any misundertanding of mine is understandable juhana kouhia clip deleted note that xv saves only bit rasterized images that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg to gif to jpeg quality also there s three kind of bit quantizers your final image quality depends on them too this were the situation when i read jpeg faq a while ago imho it is design error of xv there should not be such confusing errors in programs there s two errors xv allows the saving of bit rasterized image as jpeg even the original is bit saving bit rasterized image instead of original bit should be a special case xv allows saving the bit rasterized image made with any quantizer the main case should be that xv quantizes the image with the best quantizer available before saving the image to a file lousier quantizers should be just for viewing purposes and a special cases in saving the image if at all clip clip deleted it is limit of xv but not limit of design it is error in design it is error that bit quantized rasterized images are stored as jpegs jpeg is not designed to that as matter of fact i m sure when xv were designed bit displays were known it is not bad error to program a program for bit images only at that time but when bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support bit images that were not done and now we have the program violate jpeg design and any bit image format the program has human interface errors otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use deleted clip some new items follows clip i have seen that xv quantizes the image sometimes poorly with best option than with default option we have the reason surely is the quantizer used as best it is surprise the same than used in ppmquant if you remember i have tested some quantizers in that test i found that rlequant with default is best then comes djpeg fbmquant xv our default in that order in my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly it actually gave image with bad artifacts i don t know is ppmquant improved any but i expect no so use of xv s best option is not very good idea i suggest that author of xv changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant i m sure rle people gives permission another could be one used in imagemagick i have not tested it so i can say nothing about it clip clip some minor bugs in human interface are key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer often it happens that i make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place it is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately the buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete also good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for xv after the image is completed often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly just when i m writing something with editor or such those key pressings then go to xv and image has gone or something weird in the color editor when i turn a color meter and release it xv updates the images it is impossible to change all rgb values first and then get the updated image it is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet i suggest of adding an apply button to update the exchanges done clip

of rsa and des it allows your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication i e who sent it can be confirmed and privacy i e nobody can read it except the intended recipient ripem was written primarily by mark riordan mrr scss cl msu edu most of the code is in the public domain except for the rsa routines which are a library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc how can i get ripem ripem contains the library of cryptographic routines rsaref which is considered munitions and thus is export restricted from distribution to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the u s or canada therefore the following request is quoted from the readme file please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the usa or canada this is a personal request from me the author of ripem and a condition of your use of ripem note that rsaref is not in the public domain and a license for it is included with the distribution you should read it before using ripem the best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy since this will reduce the load on those sites that do carry it not to mention the humans that run them naturally this requires that you trust the friend ripem is available via anonymous ftp to citizens and permanent residents in the u s from rsa com cd to rsaref and read the readme file for info last i looked this site contains only the source tree and does not contain compiled binaries or the nice mac version ripem as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on rpub cl msu edu which is open to non anonymous ftp for users in the u s and canada who are citizens or permanent residents to find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pub crypt and read the file getting access for convenience binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree will ripem run on my machine probably it has already been ported to ms dos and most flavors of unix sunos next linux aix ultrix solaris etc ports to macintosh include a standard unix style port and a rather nice mac like port written by raymond lau author of stuffit more ports are expected and help of users is invited will ripem work with my mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer though the users guide included with the distribution discusses ways to use ripem with many popular mailers including berkeley mush elm and mh code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of ripem inside gnu emacs if you make a new interface for ripem or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use secure and may be useful to others feel free to post it to alt security ripem what is rsa rsa is a crypto system which is asymmetric or public key this means that there are two different related keys one to encrypt and one to decrypt because one cannot reasonably be derived from the other you may publish your encryption or public key widely and keep your decryption or private key to yourself anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it note that the message sent with rsa is normally just the des key to the real message see what is des note that the above only provides for privacy for authentication the fingerprint of the message see what is a fingerprint like md is encrypted with the sender s private key the recipient can use the sender s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender rsa was named for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invented it to find out more about rsa ftp to rsa com and look in pub faq or look in sci crypt what is des des is the data encryption standard a widely used symmetric or secret key crypto system unlike rsa des uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages however des is much faster than rsa ripem uses both des and rsa it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with des using that key it then encrypts that key with the recipient s public rsa key and includes the result in the letter allowing the recipient to recover the des key des is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it is not unlikely that future ripems will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by using multiple encryption with des what is pem and how does ripem relate pem is privacy enhanced mail a system for allowing easy transfer of encrypted electronic mail it is described in rfcs these documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specifies certificates for authenticating keys which ripem does not handle at this time their addition is planned what s this about distributing and authenticating keys for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her you must know her public key it is important that this information be accurate if a bad guy convinces her that his key is in fact yours she will send messages which he can read ripem allows for three methods of key management a central server the distributed finger servers and a flat file all three are described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security why do all ripem public keys look very similar ripem public keys begin with a pkcs identifier describing various characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people s keys this does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class of key were generated with the same program are of the same length etc what is a fingerprint like md md is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc it provides a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it is cryptographically secure because it is not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender s private key only the md of the message needs to be signed for authentication md is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to bits of data as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md is described in its entirety including an implementation in c in rfc what is pgp pgp is another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp has been around longer than ripem and works somewhat differently pgp is not compatible with ripem in any way though pgp does also use rsa some major differences between pgp and ripem pgp has more key management features particularly for users without a direct network connection ripem conforms to the pem rfcs and thus has a greater probability of working with other pem software pgp makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than pgp in fact pgp is not compatible with pgp ripem uses rsaref a library of rsa routines from rsa data security inc rsaref comes with a license which allows noncommercial use pgp uses its own implementation of rsa which is not licensed thus pkp the firm holding the u s patents on the rsa algorithm claims that it is a infringement of that patent to make use or sell pgp in the u s or canada in acknowledgement of this pgp s original author phil zimmermann says in the documentation in fact if you live in the usa and you are not a federal agency you shouldn t actually run pgp on your computer because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem are export restricted and cannot be sent outside the u s and canada however pgp already exists on many ftp sites in europe and other places whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues note that the above facts both regarding patent and export restrictions are somewhat controversial many people think it shouldn t be that way and some people interpret various documents differently unfortunately discussions of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light and probably belong in misc legal computing see disclaimer what about rpem rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail it was similar to ripem but used a public key cipher invented by rabin which is not rsa in an attempt to avoid the patent on rsa it was written by mark riordan the same author as ripem its distribution was halted when contrary to the beliefs of many including rabin public key partners pkp claimed that their patent was broad enough to cover any public key cipher whose strength rested in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes not just rsa this claim is not universally accepted by any means but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons rpem is not really used anymore it is not compatible with ripem or pgp what is mime mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions and is described in rfc you can find out about it in the newsgroup comp mail mime how pem should interact with mime is not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution of having a mime type application x ripem in order to send ripem messages as mime ones i hope some standards will emerge draft internet documents exist on the matter i have this simple way to defeat the security of ripem you may wish to check the companion post ripem attacks which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on ripem s security and what procedures will minimize the risk ripem s main weak area is probably key distribution

modern standards however it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency it is not likely that the pem standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future because there is a strong feeling that pem should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability what is a fingerprint like md md is a message digest algorithm produced by rsa data security inc it provides a bit fingerprint or cryptographically secure hash of the plaintext it is cryptographically secure because it is not possible in a reasonable amount of computation to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint thus instead of signing the entire message with the sender s private key only the md of the message needs to be signed for authentication md s can also be exchanged directly for authentication for example ripem public keys include an md of the public key in the file so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange md s of keys and verify their accuracy md is sometimes used for other purposes for example it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to bits of data as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator md is described in its entirety including an implementation in c in rfc there have been some recent suggestions that md may not be as strong a hash as was originally believed presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true what is pem pem is privacy enhanced mail a standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a working group of experts it is described in rfcs these documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs ripem is not really a complete implementation of pem because pem specifies certificates for authenticating keys which ripem does not handle at this time their addition is planned what s this about distributing and authenticating keys for a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you she must know your public key for you to be able to confirm that the message received

allows for three methods of key management a central server the distributed finger servers and a flat file all three are described in the ripem users guide which is part of the distribution none of them provide perfect security the pem standard calls for key management by certificates the addition of this feature to ripem is planned but chicken egg issues still exist isn t it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like pem this issue has been considered in the standards process rfc the specification for internet standards has a discussion section on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patented method to be included in a standard rfc addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public key cryptography this does not of course mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement an interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public key cryptography is in the league for programming freedom archive available via ftp ftp uu net doc lpf in the files bidzos letter and bidzos response amusingly the lpf files on ftp uu net are compressed with a patented algorithm what about rsadsi pkp rsa data security inc rsadsi is a california based company specializing in cryptographic technologies public key partners is a firm which holds exclusive sub licensing rights of the following u s patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents cryptographic apparatus and method diffie hellman no public key cryptographic apparatus and method hellman merkle no cryptographic communications system and method rsa no exponential cryptographic apparatus and method hellman pohlig no pkp claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography the two businesses are rather closely related for example the same person jim bidzos is president of both of them pkp has licensed this technology to a considerable number of companies ibm dec motorola at t lotus for use in their products pkp has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents ripem was originally created with no connection to rsadsi other than its use of the rsaref library and for no reason other than its author s desire to see widespread use of public key cryptography however after the ball started rolling people at rsadsi got interested rsadsi decided to carry ripem on its ftp site and some people there started making their own ripem keys and contributing code ripem even won the best application built on rsaref in award why do all ripem public keys look very similar ripem public keys begin with a pkcs public key cryptography standards identifier describing various characteristics about the key so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people s keys this does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class of key were generated with the same program are of the same length etc

comes with a license allowing noncommercial use pgp uses its own implementation of rsa pkp claims that it is a violation of its patents to make use or sell pgp in the u s or canada without either a license or written permission see disclaimer see what about rsadsi pkp phil zimmermann the author of pgp stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal action he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged but it hasn t happened and there seems little prospect of it happening in the future he acknowledges in the pgp user s guide in fact if you live in the usa and you are not a federal agency you shouldn t actually run pgp on your computer because public key partners wants to forbid you from running my software pgp is contraband both pgp and ripem are export restricted and cannot be sent outside the u s and canada without an export license however pgp already exists on many ftp sites in europe and other places whether you use pgp or ripem or whatever the documentation to pgp is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues unfortunately it s not distributed separately from the program which can be difficult to find in the u s on ftp sites due to liability

companion post ripem attacks which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on ripem s security and what procedures will minimize the risk ripem s main weak area is probably key distribution
sci.crypt	ripem frequently noted vulnerabilities archive name ripem attacks last update mar some possible attacks on ripem this is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open for when using ripem for secure electronic mail it does not go into great detail and is almost certainly not exhaustive obviously many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general and will pertain to secure mail programs other than ripem it is maintained by marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu it is posted monthly to a variety of news groups followups pertaining specifically to ripem should go to alt security ripem cryptanalysis attacks breaking rsa would allow an attacker to find out your private key in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign messages with your private key rsa is generally believed to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic techniques even a standard key about bits with ripem is long enough to render this impractical barring a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring breaking des would allow an attacker to read any given message since the message itself is encrypted with des it would not allow an attacker to claim to be you des has only bits in its key and thus could conceivably be compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware but few agencies have such money to devote to simply read one message since each message has a different des key the work for each message would remain high key management attacks stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking rsa to safeguard it it is encrypted with a des key which is derived from a passphrase you type in however if an attacker can get a copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase by snooping network packets tapping lines or whatever he could break the whole scheme the main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted link so don t do that run ripem on a trusted machine preferably one sitting right in front of you ideally your own machine in your own home or maybe office which nobody else has physical access to fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him rather than to the real recipient if the enemy can fool your intended recipient as well he could re encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along it is important to get the proper public keys of other people the most common mechanism for this is finger assuming the opponent has not compromised routers or daemons or such finger can be given a fair amount of trust the strongest method of key authentication is to exchange keys in person however this is not always practical having other people vouch for you by signing a statement containing your key is possible although ripem doesn t have features for doing this as automatically as pgp ripem does generate and check md fingerprints of public keys in the key files they may be exchanged via a separate channel for authentication playback attacks even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography an opponent could still cause difficulties for example suppose you send a message with mic only a pem mode which does not provide disclosure protection to alice which says ok let s do that your opponent intercepts it and now resends it to bob who now has a message which is authenticated as from you telling him to do that of course he may interpret it in an entirely different context or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later figuring it would be seen differently at a later time or the opponent could change the originator name to himself register your public key as his and send a message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating perhaps even quoting the unknown message to defeat playback attacks the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient and a unique identifier typically the date a good front end script for ripem should do this automatically imho as a recipient you should be sure that the originator name header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same that you really are a recipient and that the message is not an old one some this also can and should be automated the author of this faq has made a modest attempt at automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated headers the programs are included in the standard distribution in the utils directory local attacks clearly the security of ripem cannot be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption is performed for example under unix a super user could manage to get at your encrypted mail although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the ripem executable with a trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext depending how it s stored in addition the link between you and the machine running ripem is an extension of that if you decrypt with ripem on a remote machine which you are connected to via network or worse yet modem an eavesdropper could see the plaintext and probably also your passphrase ripem should only be executed on systems you trust obviously in the extreme case ripem should only be used on your own machine which you have total control over and which nobody else has access to which has only carefully examined software known to be free of viruses and so on however there s a very real trade off between convenience and security here a more moderately cautious user might use ripem on a unix workstation where other people have access even root access but increase security by keeping private keys and the statically linked of course executable on a floppy disk some people will keep ripem on a multi user system but when dialing in over an insecure line they will download the message to their own system and perform the ripem decryption there however the security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in you ve just given away the store since the attacker can now log in as you and install traps in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from a less insecure line this will likely remain the situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication i find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully i manage my security arrangement in my plan next to my public key so that potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are in place some people use two keys a short one which is not carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated with greater care for critical correspondence untrusted partner attacks ripem s encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the traffic however once someone with that key gets the message she may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes there exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient say taking an encrypted message and converting it to a mic only message signed by you and readable by anyone although ripem does not provide this functionality indeed the latest pem draft i have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible to allow forwarding functions to work including the recipients in the plaintext as mentioned above will make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware of its original nature naturally the security of the cryptography can never be greater than the security of the people using it

sci.crypt	licensing this thread brings up the more general question can any crypto implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not available ever be trusted after ibm had invented the des and the nbs had advertised for proposals but before ibm had decided to respond i argued strenuously that they should not they should keep it proprietary the biggest proponent of proposing was dr lewis branscomb dr branscomb was the ibm chief scientist and had come to ibm from nbs fortunately for all of us dr branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than i he realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism because of the necessary complexity publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority in fact it has taken both of those plus more than years we have also had independence the des was solicited by nbs invented and proposed by ibm and vetted by nbs it has also been examined and vetted by experts like adi shamir who are not subject to influence by any of these even now there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the des in spite of all the time all of the analysis and all of the public scrutiny of course it is just this point that nist misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism developed in secret on the basis of authority alone we had a long thread here about whether or not the nsa can break the des that is a silly question at some cost and in some time they can break anything the important question is at what cost and in what time the fundamental strength of the des and rsa are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength as long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker then we can use them in a safe way at this point we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap des and rsa are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography we are damned lucky to have them william hugh murray executive consultant information system security locust avenue suite new canaan connecticut att wmurray whmurray at dockmaster ncsc mil

email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging face in the electronic realm this is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information for example ld longs lance colostate edu people see this address when receiving mail or reading usenet posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage some obsolete forms of addresses such as bitnet still persist in email messages additional information on the path that a message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient this information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination this type of identify and forward protocol is also used in the usenet protocol to a lesser extent forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes why is identity un important on the internet the concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication privacy and security which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks for example the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification but there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems verifying that an identity is correct is called authentication and one classic example of the problems associated with it is h g well s war of the worlds radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious people and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery however the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features identity is just as useful as it is harmful a professor might carefully explain a topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate a person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him some prejudices are erased but on the other hand many prejudices are useful a scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more about the authors likewise he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria on the other side of the connection the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating credit not necessarily financial and ownership and usage many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic many government functions and services are based on identification and law enforcement frequently hinges on it hence employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures but when does identification invade privacy the growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users especially as the network becomes increasingly global universal widespread and entrenched and the positive or adverse affects of these actions intended and inadvertent will literally be magnified exponentially how does my email address not identify me and my background your email address may contain information that influences people s perceptions of your background the address may identify you as from a department at a particular university an employee at a company or a government worker it may contain your last name initials or cryptic identification codes independent of both in the us some are based on parts of social security numbers others are in the form u where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system standard internet addresses also can contain information on your broad geographical location or nationhood however none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all the fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization such as mostly invisible network cabling distributions the only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific such as specific computer names or local networks and the later ones the most general such as continental domains typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise for more information see the faqs on email addresses and known geographical distributions below however unix utilities exist to aid in the quest see the question on this common suffixes us united states uk united kingdom ca canada fi finland au australia edu university or college com commercial organization org other e g nonprofit organization gov government mil military site how can i find out more about somebody with a given email address one simple way is to send email to that address asking another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address i e postmaster address although the postmaster s job is more to help find user id s of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems the sysadmin i e root address may also be able to supply information users with related email address may have information however all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally one of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the unix utility finger the basic syntax is finger user here there everywhere this utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named the response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format possible responses are as follows a message unknown host meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect two lines with no information and a message in real life in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of a match on the username the finger utility may return this response in other situations a listing of information associated with multiple users some computers will search only for matching user ids others will attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all actual full names of users kept in a local database at some sites finger can be used to get a list of all users on the system with a finger address in general this is often considered weak security however because attackers know valid user id s to crack passwords more information on the fields returned by finger is given below more information on finger and locating people s email addresses is given in the email faq such as the whois lookup utility just as you can use these means to find out about others they can use them to find out about you you can finger yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your unix system about you be careful when modifying finger data virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information in one amazing case the new york times writer j markoff uncovered the identity of r morris author of the internet worm through the use of an anonymous tip and finger see the book cyberspace by k hafner and j markoff why is identification un stable on the internet generally identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the internet for a variety of reasons one is the inherent fluidity of cyberspace where people emerge and submerge frequently and absences are not readily noted in the community most people remember faces and voices the primary means of casual identification in the real world the arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and usenet are from who they appear to be a person s mailing address is far from an identification of an individual anyone with access to the account e g they know the password either legitimately or otherwise can send mail with that address in the from line email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations as part of current mailing protocol standards forging the from line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many hackers the status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable in general while possible forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with today s internet protocols affecting identification on the internet internet mail standards described in rfc are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly for example standards for mail address munging or parsing tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites and there are delays in the propagation of this data addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers crash such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called nameservers a whole slew of problems is associated with nameservers if they are not updated they will not find name addresses and even the operation of what constitutes updating has different interpretations at different sites the current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread with only a fraction of the traffic it now sees today a large proportion of internet traffic is email comprising millions of messages what is the future of identification on the internet some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification however they are not currently widespread require large amounts of data transfer standardized software and make some compromises in privacy promising new cryptographic techniques may make digital signatures and digital authentication common see below also the trend in usenet standards is toward greater authentication of posted information on the other hand advances in ensuring anonymity such as remailers are forthcoming see below privacy what is privacy on the internet generally while privacy has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it such as email and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches in other words others may obtain data associated with your account but not without your permission these ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains some users don t expect or want any privacy some expect and demand it why is privacy un important on the internet this is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic arousing passionate opinions on the internet some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent most governments have rules that protect privacy such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the u s constitution adopted by others but have many that are antithetical to it such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping these rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it however the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested i e no strong legal precedents and court cases the fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries and is not centrally managed significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation how in secure are internet networks theoretically people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the internet could potentially monitor or archive it however the sheer volume and general noise inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources technologies exist to tap magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection less obscurely any machine with a network connection is a potential station for traffic detection but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low level hardware the network card to pursue if even possible a company network general inc is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can filter and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use known instances of the above types of security breaches at a major scale such as at network hubs are very rare the greatest risks tend to emerge locally note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography how in secure is my account by default not very there are a multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet first your account must be secure from other users the universal system is to use a password but if it is weak i e easy to guess this security is significantly diminished somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some certain users of the system particularly the administrator generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords and may grant that access to others this means that they may read any file in your account without detection furthermore not universally known most unix systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in what commands you execute and when they are executed in fact login information is usually public most features of this auditing or process accounting information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims this information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored this data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other suspicious activities on the system a traditional part of the unix system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links described in man ln unix implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly typically system adminstrators augment the basic unix functionality with public domain programs and locally developed tools for monitoring and use them only to isolate suspicious activity as it arises e g remote accesses to the passwd file incorrect login attempts remote connection attempts etc generally you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons potentially every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else system administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks erased files can under many operating systems be undeleted most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise for example ftp sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users including anonymous ones some software exacerbates these problems see the section on x windows in security indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users a much more commonly harmful threat there are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines choose a secure password change it periodically make sure to logout always do not leave a machine unattended for long make sure no one watches you when you type your password avoid password references in email be conservative in the use of the rhost file use utilities like xlock to protect a station but be considerate be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password there are only several basic situations where unix prompts you for a password when you are logging in to a system or changing your password situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users especially in cases where you are talking to them such as internet relay chat also be aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords thanks to jim mattson mattson cs ucsd edu for contributions here how in secure are my files and directories the most important privacy considerations are related to file rights and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in unix if the x execute right on your parent directory is off for users groups and other these users cannot gain information on anything in your directories anything less may allow others to read change or even delete files in your home directory the rights on a directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory for a directory x means that access to the files or subdirectories in the directory is possible if you know their names to list the contents of the directory however requires the r right by default most accounts are accessable only to the owner but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference the default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files and can be set in the shell with umask the details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of unix consult man pages on chmod and ls examples traver lance ls ld drwx ld jan users ld here is a listing of the rights associated with a user s home directory denoted by the columns at the left identify what rights are available the first column identifies the entry as a directory and the next three columns mean that read write and execute rights respectively are permitted for that user for directories the x right means that contents file and subdirectory names within that directory can be listed the subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point they can t even see any lower files or subdirectories the hierarchy is completely invisible to them traver lance ls l msg rw r r ld jan msg traver lance chmod u rw g o msg traver lance ls l msg rw ld jan msg here the modes on the file msg were changed to take away rights from group and other note that ls l file requires both the r right to get the list of files and subdirectories and the x right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size etc for example suppose the directory foo has rights dr r r the following is possible ls foo these commands would fail independent of file rights ls l foo ls l foo file cat foo file cd foo if the directory foo has rights d x x x the following are possible if it is known beforehand that foo contains an r readable file named file ls l foo file cat foo file cd foo the following commands fail ls foo ls l foo thanks to uwe waldmann uwe mpi sb mpg de for contributions here how in secure is x windows x windows is the primary software developed by the mit athena project which is funded by u s government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks particularly the human computer interface the software implements a client server interface to a computer via graphical windows in this case the client is the application requesting or utilizing graphical resources such as windows or a mouse and the server is the machine that provides them in many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server the great utility of x windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be broadcast to a server at a remote location from the client unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep intricate and complicated security considerations the primary security and privacy issue associated with x windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network and over wider regions than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in x windows due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws early versions of the x window system are extremely insecure anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix by any regular user there are no protections from this type of access in these versions the problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users such that any user at a trusted machine is himself trusted quoting from x documentation man xsecurity any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed access to the x server this system can work reasonably well in an environment where everyone trusts everyone or when only a single person can log into a given machine this system does not work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and mutual trust does not exist with the access control list the xhost command may prevent some naive attempts i e those other than the direct access unix evasion the syntax as typed on the host machine is xhost name where name is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine by default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled public domain programs to disrupt a display momentarily such as flip or slowly mirror the screen image or cause pixels to melt down to the bottom have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses the minimal easily bypassed trusted security mode of xhost has been jokingly referred to as x hanging open security terrible new versions of the x window system x r and higher by default make server access as secure as the file system using a xauthority file and magic cookies remote machines must have a code in the xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server many older programs and even new vendor supplied code does not support or is incompatible with magic cookies the basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission x r also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms try man xsecurity to find out what is supported at your site even though improved security mechanisms have been available in x windows since local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex thanks to marc vanheyningen mvanheyn whale cs indiana edu jim mattson mattson cs ucsd edu and bill marshall marshall cs iastate edu for contributions here how in secure is my email by default not very the characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ascii the american standard code for information interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa virtually every computer system uses this code and if not has ways of converting to and from it when you write a mail message by default it is being sent in ascii and since the standard is virtually universal there is no intrinsic privacy despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows the most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the spool files at a local site i e at the source or destination of the message such as a university system administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in their entirety this means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human other than the recipient typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden finally be aware that some mailing lists email addresses of everyone on a list are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms this feature can be disabled most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end to end cryptography which has its own set of caveats for example unscrupulous administrators may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal see the sections on email privacy and email policies how am i not liable for my email and postings as punishment or whatever your system administrator can revoke certain privileges such as emailing usenet posting or reading certain groups file transferring remote communications or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account this all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at a particular site which in many cases are haphazard and crisis oriented currently there are virtually no widespread uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use to any internet services and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations in the typical scenario complaint s reach a system adminstrator regarding abuses by a user usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email regarding that person s objectionable email or postings abusive posters to usenet are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the net the debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used as a questionable means of attacking or silencing harmless crackpots or censoring unpopular opinions system administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to squelch severe cases of abuse in general however by tradition usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message referred to as hitting the n key or to plonk annoying posters according to the hacker s dictionary the sound a jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file in cases where punitive actions are applied generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email usenet postings are much more commonly restricted either to individual users or entire groups such as a university campus restrictions are most commonly associated with the following abuses harassing or threatening notes email terrorism illegal uses e g piracy or propagation of copyrighted material ad hominem attacks i e insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness inappropriate postings esp binary files in regular groups mail bombing inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations many people put disclaimers in their signatures

liability notes on university liability for usenet how do i provide more less information to others on my identity the public information of your identity and account is mostly available though the unix utility finger described above you have control over most of this information with the utility chfn the specifics vary between sites on some systems use passwd f you can provide unlimited information in the plan file which is copied directly to the destination during the fingering a technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is finger ing you and even to vary the plan file sent to them your signature is determined by the environment variable signature usenet signatures are conventionally stored in the signature file in your home directory providing less information on your online identity is more difficult and involved one approach is to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you such as your full name you may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally you may be able to remotely login via modem or otherwise to computers that you are not physically near these are tactics for hiding or masking your online activities but nothing is foolproof consult man pages on the chmod command and the default file mode generally files on a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators to mask your identity in email or on usenet you can use different accounts more untraceable are new anonymous posting and remailing services that are very recently being established see below who is my sysadmin what does s he know about me the requirements and screening for getting a system administration job and thereby access to all information on a system vary widely between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax especially at universities many unix systems at universities are largely managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often hacking in general commercial and industrial sites are more strict on qualifications and background and government sites are extremely strict the system adminstrator root user can monitor what commands you used and at what times s he may have a record backups of files on your account over a few weeks s he can monitor when you send email or post usenet messages and potentially read either s he may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using both locally and elsewhere administrators sometimes employ specialized programs to track strange or unusual activity which can potentially be misused why is privacy un stable on the internet for the numerous reasons listed above privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet furthermore large parts of the internet are funded by the u s nsf national science foundation which places certain restrictions on its use such as prohibiting commercial use some high level officials in this and other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to guarantee privacy such as encryption and anonymous services historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been local perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some portion of usenet newsgroups labelled as pornographic the alternative hierarchy in the usenet system which has virtually no restrictions on propagation and new group creation is frequently targeted although this material may appear anywhere from the global point of view traffic is generally completely unimpeded on the internet and only the most egregious offenders are pursued for example verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted material such as newspaper or magazine articles are posted to usenet with regularity without major consequences some email complaints may ensue more astonishing to some is that currently significant portions of usenet traffic and less so internet traffic is comprised of sexually explicit digitized images almost entirely originating from copyrighted material newsgroups such as alt sex regularly have the highest traffic what is the future of privacy on the internet some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or appropriate level of privacy others will argue that as a prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate safeguards the internet is growing to become a completely global international superhighway for data and this traffic will inevitably entail data such as voice messages postal mail and many other items of extremely personal nature computer items that many people consider completely private such as their local hard drives will literally be inches from global network connections also sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet most would agree that for these basic but sensitive uses of the internet no significant mechanisms are currently in place to ensure much privacy new standards are calling for uniform introduction of privacy enhanced mail pem which uses encryption technologies to ensure privacy so that privacy protection is automatic and may significantly improve safeguards the same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy such as with surreptitious surveilance can be overwhelmingly effective in protecting it e g with encryption some government agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general and believe that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct e g court authorized wiretapping however powerful new technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming increasingly popular provoking some to say that the cat is out of the bag and the genie can t be put back in the bottle in less idiomatic terms they believe that the spread of strong cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable to date no feasible system that guarantees both secure communication and government oversight has been proposed the two goals are largely incompatible proposals for registration of secret keys by d denning on sci crypt for example have been met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections of inherent feasibility electronic privacy issues and particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few years anonymity what is anonymity on the internet simply stated anonymity is the absence of identity the ultimate in privacy however there are several variations on this simple theme a person may wish to be consistently identified by a certain pseudonym or handle and establish a reputation under it in some area providing pseudo anonymity a person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one way message a sort of hit and run or a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others with either known or anonymous identities via an anonymous return address a user may wish to appear as a regular user but actually be untraceable sometimes a user wishes to hide who he is sending mail to in addition to the message itself the anonymous item itself may be directed at individuals or groups a user may wish to access some service and hide all signs of the association all of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently tricky to carry out in practice because of all the tracking mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols officials of the nsf and other government agencies may be opposed to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse nevertheless the inherent facelessness of large networks will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity why is anonymity un important on the internet anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depending on its use arguably absence of identification is important as the presence of it it may be the case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted because true anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish one can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly such as employer employee scenarios one can use it to pass information and evade any threat of direct retribution for example whistleblowers reporting on government abuses economic social or political can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or retaliation sensitive personal potentially damaging information is often posted to some usenet groups a risky situation where anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely independent of the identities of the participants some police departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of crimes such uses would be straightforward on the network unfortunately extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurances of anonymity how can anonymity be protected on the internet the chief means as alluded to above are masking identities in email and posting however anonymous accounts public accounts as accessable and anonymous as e g public telephones may be effective as well but this use is generally not officially supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and nsf guidelines the nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to anonymity virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet new communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication what is anonymous mail one approach to anonymizing mail has been to set up an anonymous server that when activated by email to its address responds by allocating and supplying an anonymous id that is unique to the person requesting it based on his email address this will vary for the same person for different machine address email originations to send anonymous mail the user sends email directed to the server containing the final destination the server anonymizes the message by stripping of identification information and forwards the message which appears to originate from the anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id this is the interactive use of anonymity or pseudonymity mentioned above another more fringe approach is to run a cypherpunk remailer from a regular user account no root system privileges are required these are currently being pioneered by eric hughes and hal finney hal alumni caltech edu the operator runs a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail typically fields in the header one has been implemented as a perl script running on unix several of these are in existence currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge the remailers don t generally support anonymous return addresses mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system although actually may be held liable regardless these approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses the anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of anonymous id s to real addresses that must be maintained indefinitely one alternative is to allow deallocation of aliases at the request of the user but this has not been implemented yet although an unlikely scenario traffic to any of these sites could conceivably be monitored from the outside necessitating the use of cryptography for basic protection local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local network or government agencies unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic that goes through them most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected the cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operators are basically network users who do not own the equipment and are accountable to their own system administrators who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered regarding it as illicit use in all cases a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous server operator by the user currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using smtp protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information this practice not uncommon to hackers and the approach used by remailers is generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators information in the header routing data and logs of network port connection information may be retained that can be used to track the originating site in practice this is generally infeasible and rarely carried out some administrators on the network will contact local administrators to request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished more severely such as revoking the account all of this actually happening occasionally but infrequently see the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites and responsibilities associated with anonymity what is anonymous posting anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous usenet posting with all the associated caveats above monitored traffic capricious or risky local circumstances logging make sure to test the system at least once by e g anonymous posting to misc test however some operators don t recommend this because many sites autorespond to test messages possibly causing the anonymous server to allocate anonymous ids for those machines see the responsibilties associated with anonymous posting before proceeding another direct route involves using nntp protocols to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information this practice not uncommon to hackers is also generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators and similar consequences can ensue see the sections known anonymous mail and posting sites and responsibilities associated with anonymity why is anonymity un stable on the internet as noted many factors compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community and these services should be used with great caution to summarize the technology is in its infancy and current approaches are unrefined unreliable and not completely trustworthy no standards have been established and troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software are prevalent here are some encountered and potential bugs one anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous return addresses others passed signature information embedded in messages unaltered address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced to a remailer are common forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem possibly allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon id email address mappings in the alias file this can be remedied with the use of passwords infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers source code is being distributed tested and refined for these systems but standards are progressing slowly and weakly the field is not likely to improve considerably without official endorsement and action by network agencies the whole idea is essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet seen as illegitimate or favorable to criminality the major objection to anonymity over regular internet use is the perceived lack of accountability to system operators i e invulnerability to account restrictions resulting from outside complaints system adminstrators at some sites have threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the prominent servers from their redistribution flows this may only have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less characteristically detectable headers probably the least problematic approach and the most traditional to usenet is for individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer e g ignoring it or filtering it with kill files what is the future of anonymity on the internet new anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase safeguards of anonymity for example the same mechanism that routes email over multiple hosts thereby threatening its privacy can also be used to guarantee it in a scheme called chaining an anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers before reaching a destination in this way generally multiple links of the chain have to be broken for security to be compromised re encryption at each link makes this scenario even more unlikely even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message tracing however remailers run by corrupt operators are possible the future of anonymous services on the internet is at this time highly uncertain and fraught with peril while specific groups seem to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in serious groups the introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussions on usenet conventions and distribution mechanisms such as moderated and alt groups have had in the past for example as part of new group creation the charter may specify whether anonymous posting is un welcome nevertheless the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable based on traffic statistics anonymous services are in huge demand pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequences however if its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may be confined to the underground the ramifications of widespread introduction of anonymity to usenet are still largely unknown it is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new traffic or instead of expansion cause a shift where a greater portion of existing traffic is anonymized conceivably the services could play a role in influencing future

many on their meaning especially on the internet in the general news media in the past a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends such as breaking into systems has been referred to as a hacker but most internet users prefer the term cracker for this instead a hacker is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious curious and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a system for example something of a proud electronic pioneer and patriot this is the sense intended in this document see also the hacker s dictionary and the faq alt security faq what is a cypherpunk

mailing list below see also the cryptoanarchist manifesto and the cryptography glossary in soda berkeley edu pub cypherpunks what is steganography and anonymous pools closely associated with encryption is steganography or the techniques for not only pursuing private encrypted communication but concealing the very existence of the communication itself many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the proliferation of computer technology for example it is possible to encode messages in the least significant bits of images typically the most noisy in addition when such an item is posted in a public place such as a newsgroup virtually untraceable communication can take place between sender and receiver for steganographic communications in the electronic realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual users decode particular messages with their unique key an anonymous pool has been set up by miron cuperman miron extropia wimsey com for experiments send email to pool request extropia wimsey com with one of the following commands in the subject line subscribe unsubscribe help what is security through obscurity security through obscurity refers to the attempt to gain protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information or programs relating to them for example a company may not make public information on its software s encryption techniques to evade attacks based on knowledge of it another example would be concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in operating systems or some reliance may be made on the fact that some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious because they are not widely known or not widely used this argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and usenet posting forgery security through obscurity is regarded as a very feeble technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at worst also called the head in the sand approach see the faq for alt security some remarks of john perry barlow cofounder of the electronic frontier foundation directed to nsa agents at the first international symposium on national security national competitiveness held in mclean virginia dec digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep contained this stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile it s almost a life form in its ability to self propagate if something hits the net and it s something which people on there find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind i believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into an environment where any information which is at all interesting to people is going to get out and there will be very little that you can do about it this is not a bad thing in my view but you may differ what are identity daemons rfc describes a protocol standard that allows unix programs to query a remote user s login name after connection to a local communication socket a connection of this type is established during ftp and telnet sessions for example the standard is not widely supported perhaps of internet sites currently implement it but the number is increasing the mechanism is detrimental to anonymity regular users cannot disable it but system adminstrators can circumvent it this standard may represent a trend toward greater

credit card fraud and long distance call thievery see ftp eff org pub sjg general information effector operation sundevil the phoenix inspired crackdown of may concentrated on telephone code fraud and credit card abuse and followed this seizure plan with some success bulletin board systems went down all over america terrifying the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of their criminal instruments it also saddled analysts with some floppy disks and confronted harried justice department prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide hacker show trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of jurisdictions massive show trials never materialized although isolated instances of prosecution were pursued the movement reached a crescendo in texas with the highly publicized case of illegal search and seizure involving the steve jackson games company of austin texas on march from the column gurps labour lost by bruce sterling bruces well sf ca us in fantasy and science fiction magazine in an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional warrant agents of the secret service conducted a search of the sjg office when they left they took a manuscript being prepared for publication private electronic mail and several computers including the hardware and software of the sjg computer bulletin board system yet jackson and his business were not only innocent of any crime but never suspects in the first place the raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that somewhere in jackson s office there might be a document compromising the security of the telephone system fbi agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed on behalf of steve jackson games by the electronic frontier foundation see information on eff below from an article by joe abernathy in the houston chronicle feb austin an electronic civil rights case against the secret service closed thursday with a clear statement by federal district judge sam sparks that the service failed to conduct a proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown and went too far in retaining custody of seized equipment secret service special agent timothy foley of chicago who was in charge of three austin computer search and seizures on march that led to the lawsuit stoically endured spark s rebuke over the service s poor investigation and abusive computer seizure policies while the service has seized dozens of computers since the crackdown began in this is the first case to challenge the practice sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the austin science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never suspected of a crime and that agents did not do even marginal research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and the suspected illegal activities of an employee or to determine that the company was a publisher indeed agents testified that they were not even trained in the privacy protection act at the special secret service school on computer crime how long would it have taken you mr foley to find out what steve jackson games did what it was asked sparks an hour was there any reason why on march you could not return to steve jackson games a copy in floppy disk form of everything taken did you read the article in business week magazine where it had a picture of steve jackson a law abiding tax paying citizen saying he was a computer crime suspect did it ever occur to you mr foley that seizing this material could harm steve jackson economically foley replied no sir

privacy experts software manufacturers and telephone companies the fbi proposed legislation to amend the communications act of to make it easier for the bureau to perform electronic wiretapping the proposed legislation entitled digital telephony would have required communications service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their systems tappable by providing back doors through which law enforcement officers could intercept communications furthermore this capability would have been provided undetectably while the communications was in progress exclusive of any communications between other parties regardless of the mobility of the target of the fbi s investigation and without degradation of service under the proposal the department of justice doj can keep communications products off the market if it determines that these products do not meet the doj s own guidelines this could result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for service providers and equipment manufacturers since they will be unlikely to add any features that may result in a doj rejection of their entire product the fbi proposal suggests that the cost of this wiretapping service to the bureau would have to be borne by the service provider itself the electronic frontier foundation organized a broad coalition of public interest and industry groups from computer professionals for

person it s up to you to learn how to speak english properly and make whatever use you please of it though the government provides certain subsidies to help you learn to read and write a bit otherwise everybody just sort of pitches in and somehow the thing evolves on its own and somehow turns out workable and interesting fascinating even though a lot of people earn their living from using and

are mostly untested problematic or unsupported at this time what are the responsibilities associated with anonymity users use anonymity only if you have to frivolous uses weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others do not use anonymity to provoke harass or threaten others do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on usenet such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups if posting large files be attentive to bandwidth considerations remember simply sending the posting to the service increases network traffic avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of usenet this is the mostly likely place to alienate readers the alt hierarchy is preferred give as much information as possible in the posting i e references etc remember that content is the only means for readers to judge the truth of the message and that any inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even future ones under the same handle be careful not to include information that will reveal your identity or enable someone to deduce it test the system by sending anonymized mail to yourself be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege be considerate and respectful of other s objections to anonymity hit and run anonymity should be used with utmost reservation use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead be courteous to the system operator who may have invested large amounts of time be personally risking his account or dedicating his hardware all for your convenience operators document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an introductory file that is sent to new users have a coherent and consistent policy and stick to it state clearly what logging and monitoring is occurring describe your background interest and security measures will the general approach be totalitarian or lassaiz faire formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas what if a user is blackmailing someone through your service what if a user posts suicidal messages through your service remember your users trust you to protect them in the site introductory note give clear examples of situations where you will take action and what these actions will be e g warn the user limit anonymity to email or posting only revoke the account out the user contact local administrator etc describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware address the bandwidth limitations of your site report candidly and thoroughly all bugs that have occurred work closely with users to isolate and fix bugs address all bugs noted below under in stability of anonymity document the stability of the site how long has it been running what compromises have occured why are you running it what is your commitment to it include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages include an address for complaints ideally appended to every outgoing item consult a lawyer about your liability be committed to the long term stability of the site be prepared to deal with complaints and hate mail addressed to you if you do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system adminstrator consult those who do and are be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups if possible query group readers keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message format that can be screened effectively by kill files ensure the key text anon is somewhere in every header take precautions to ensure the security of the server from physical and network based attacks and infiltrations readers do not complain attack or discredit a poster for the sole reason that he is posting anonymously make blanket condemnations that equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality or assail anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons e g its volume is heavy or increasing react to the anonymous information unemotionally abusive posters will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate responses sometimes the most effective response is silence notify operators if very severe abuses occur such as piracy harassment extortion etc do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they offend you personally use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the idea of anonymity itself avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings should be barred from particular groups because no possible or conceivable need exists references see e g ftp eff org pub academic anonymity this article is an excerpt from an issue of fidonews on individual privacy and the use of handles it accepts the need of a system operator to know the name of a user but suggests that the use of a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a letter to the editor the article concludes with a set of guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous how do i kill anonymous postings james thomas green jgreen zeus calpoly edu try putting this in your kill file anon h j anonymous h j this will search the headers of the messages and kill any that contain anon or anonymous in them not perfect and won t kill followups note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask anonymous postings under which the above method will not work so far this practice is not widespread but it may become more common as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering what is the history behind anonymous posting servers originally anonymous posting services were introduced for individual particularly volatile newsgroups where anonymity is almost the preferred method of communication such as talk abortion and alt sex bondage one of the first was one by dave mack started in for alt sex bondage another early one was wizvax methuen ma us run by stephanie gilgut gilgut enterprises but was disbanded due to lack of funds the system provided anonymous return addresses n kbt rain com john opalko took up the functions of this server including reinstating the anonymous alias file the group alt personals has been chewing through servers like there s no tomorrow spurred by the disappearance of wizvax and interested in researching the idea karl kleinpaste karl kleinpaste godiva nectar cs cmu edu developed his own system from scratch in six hours by this time the idea of extending the server to new more mainstream groups was starting to emerge and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request by multiple users for anonymity in other groups the intended advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group support with a single anon identifier across all this was arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems k kleinpaste posted a message on rec nude asking users whether an anonymous service would be welcome there and judged a consensus against it k kleinpaste introduced what he calls a fire extinguisher to squelch or plonk abusive users in response to complaints and used this in three cases nevertheless after a few months of intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his server even as restricted as it was my system was subjected to abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the facilities staff here such abuses started right after it was created in nov johan helsingius julf penet fi set up the most controversial anonymous site to date anon penet fi is based on scripts and c code written by k kleinpaste and supports anonymized mail posting and return addresses he initially wanted to confine the service to scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide accessability in response to lots of international requests j helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every usenet newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological opposition e g by news adminstrators in news admin policy because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium abuses by anonymous posters tend to have higher visibility than routine abuses his total commitment to preservation of anonymity is also controversial for example in a highly controversial and publicized case in feb an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate crew dialogue during the challenger shuttle disaster via anon penet fi to sci astro despite that the transcript had been posted in the same place up to a year earlier then non anonymously and actually originated not with the poster but a new york news tabloid subsequent responses consisted largely of vociferous outrage at the poster s use of anonymity reverberating through many newsgroups the original poster using the same anonymous handle later conceded that the story seemed likely to have been fabricated suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of the story albeit crudely free of personal risk from perceived association with the item the ensuing commotion generated queries for the original article by late entering readers the anonymous user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his detractors despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints and even the vocal opposition and verbal abuse of k kleinpaste and eminent news operators j helsingius has largely avoided use of the fire extingisher and the group bouncer mechanisms that limit the scope of the service as of march the anon penet fi site is best described as inundated it has registered over users in its initial three months of operation forwards messages a day and approximately of all usenet postings are anonymized through the site the immense popularity is probably largely due to the capability for global anonymity which has allowed users to find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned johan helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to dismantle his server in feb at one point k kleinpaste threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate news operators to send out revocation commands on all messages originating from the site j helsingius has also alluded to threats of flooding the server the server has crashed several times at least once due to a saturation mailbombing through it by an anonymous user mr helsingius reports spending up to hours per day answering email requests alone associated with the service s administration in response to the serious threats he disabled global group access temporarily for one week and encouraged his users to defend the service publicly based on fast moving dialogue and creative suggestions by cypherpunks j helsingius has identified many security weaknesses and valuable new features for the service and is currently in the process of code development and testing he is planning on upgrading the ibm compatible machine to a soon to handle the voluminous load and is considering integrating a new system with very sophisticated functionality including multiple email aliases alias allocation control public key encryption etc a very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in dec by d clunie dclunie pax tpa com au that used cryptography in both directions to from the server for the highest degree of confidentiality seen so far however it was running on a public access account and he had to shut it down after only several weeks upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately originating from nsf representatives d clunie has released the software to the public domain recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to whistleblowing on government abuses has received wide and focused attention and group formation is currently underway in the basic scenario the group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable digital signatures the traffic may eventually reach reporters in the mainstream news media deltorto aol com has volunteered to attack multiple aspects of this project including distributing easy to read documentation on posting anonymization and encryption see also sections on views on anonymous posting below and what is going on with anon penet fi in this document thanks to carl kleinpaste karl kleinpaste godiva nectar cs cmu edu david clunie dclunie pax tpa com au and johan helsingius julf penet fi for contributions here what is the value of anonymity kondared purccvm bitnet i think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the content of one s message sure lot of anonymous posts are abusive or frivolous but in most cases these are by users who find the anon facility novel once the novelty wears off they are stopping their pranks morgan engr uky edu wes morgan i don t mind seeing the miscellaneous hatred prejudice racism those things are part of our nature however the notion of providing anonymity s shield for these ideas repulses me if they have such strong feelings why can t they put their name s on their postings quite frankly i loathe communication with people who refuse to use their names dclunie pax tpa com au david clunie many seem to question the value of anonymity but who are they to say what risks another individual should take there is no question that in this rather conservative society that we live in holding certain views making certain statements adopting a certain lifestyle are likely to result in public censure ridicule loss of status employment or even legal action given the heterogeneity of the legal jurisdictions from where the many contributors to usenet post who knows what is legal and what is not some say that anonymous posters are cowards and should stand up and be counted perhaps that is one point of view but what right do these detractors have to exercise such censorship from doug cc ysu edu doug sewell why is it censorship to not expect someone to speak for themselves without the cloak of anonymity this is at best a lame argument you tell me why what you have to say requires anonymity and you tell me why the wishes of a majority of non anonymous users of a newsgroup should be disregarded when they don t want anonymous posts anonymous users have less rights than any others they are not legitimate usenet participants i would not honor rfds cfvs control messages or votes from one brad clarinet com brad templeton i can think of no disadvantage caused by anon posting sites that doesn t already exist other than the fact that they do make more naive net users who don t know how to post anonymously the old way more prone to do it from mandel netcom com tom mandel i cannot speak for others but i regard anonymous postings in a serious discussion as pretty much worthless views that hide behind the veil of anon are hardly worth the trouble of reading n anon penet fi hank pankey since i began posting anonymously to show support for general principles of personal privacy i have been subject to far more abuse and attack than i ever received before people seem to find it easier to flame and insult someone whose name they don t know perhaps it s easier to pretend that there is no person behind the email address who feels the sting of abusive comments anonymity does hinder some methods of controlling other posters actions people who seek such control will naturally oppose it from acearl leo bsuvc bsu edu instead of making this a free er medium by allowing posters to protect themselves with anonymity simply require that all posters be prepared to discuss their sources of information and take the heat for unsubstantiated dribble this seems to be the way things are currently done xtkmg trentu ca kate gregory in misc kids there are three threads going on started by anonymous posters one was about changing jobs so as to work less hours job sharing and so on from a woman who didn t want anyone at her current place of work to know she was thinking of looking for work elsewhere the next was from a woman who is thinking of having a baby sometime soon and doesn t want coworkers friends family etc etc to know all about it but who wants advice the third is about sex after parenthood actually this was started by people posting in the usual way but then it was pointed out that the anonymous posting service might let more people participate misc kids doesn t seem to be suffering any harm from the presence of anonymous posters in fact it seems to have been helped by it hoey zogwarg etl army mil dan hoey while there has never been any real security against anonymous or forged postings on usenet the process has until now been sufficiently inconvenient error prone and undocumented to limit its use by persons who have not learned the culture of the net on the other hand a recent use of the anonymous posting service on sci math seemed seemed to be a student asking help on a homework problem it has now been attributed to a teacher asking for an explanation of a dubious answer in his teaching guide he says his news posting is broken so he is using the anonymous service as a mail to news gateway karl barrus elee sf menudo uh edu some argue that the opinions of the people who hide behind a veil of anonymity are worthless and that people should own up to their thoughts i agree with the latter point in an ideal world we would all be sitting around engaging in socratic dialogues freely exchanging our opinions in an effort to learn but in an ideal world nobody will threaten you for your thoughts or ridicule you but we live in a world where the people who don t agree with you may try to harm you let s face it some people aren t going to agree with your opinion no matter how logically you try to present it or how reasoned out it may be this is sad since it does restrict people from voicing their opinions red redpoll neoucom edu richard e depew the consensus seems to be that a general anonymous posting service such as that at anon penet fi seems sufficiently corrosive of the trust and civility of the net that this particular experiment should be ended perhaps the next time the question comes up we can say we tried it we learned it does more harm than good and we stopped it from c vm urz uni heidelberg de alexander eichener anonymous posting has not created major problems aside from angering irate people like you who would rather ban anonymous pseudonymous posting altogether because real men can stand up for what they said or comparable puerile arguments as others have brought up dave elxr jpl nasa gov dave hayes what a primal example of human nature i have three questions for you folks do people really say different things to each other based upon whether their identity is or isn t known are people really so affected by what other people say that the verbage is labeled abuse most importantly on a forum that prizes itself on the freedom of communication that it enjoys is there really such a thing as freedom of communication from terry geovision gvc com terry mcgonigal sigh just how many anon services are needed will everybody start running one soon what s the purpose who stands to benefit when there are n anon services then n then n out there where has this sudden fasination with anon services come from for better or imho worse it looks like we er gonna get stuck with these things and as much as i don t like the idea of services like this becoming the norm i don t really think there s much to be done since it s obvious that anyone who wants to can set one up with a bit of work karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu karl kleinpaste weak reasoning with freedom comes responsibility dave elxr jpl nasa gov dave hayes responsibility isn t real if it is enforced true responsibilty comes with no coercion should anonymous posting to all groups be allowed morgan engr uky edu wes morgan i will be the first to admit that i hold some controversial opinions indeed i m sure that none of us are completely orthodox in our opinions however i ve received hundreds of anonymous email messages over the last few years fewer than of them were reasonable posts made with good motives it s getting more and more difficult to remember why we need anonymity at all the abusers are once again lousing things up for those who truly need the service or those who would put it to good use i m not suggesting that we should ban anonymous servers as i ve said there are several situations in which anonymity is a good thing tm however the notion that anonymity s shield should be automatically extended to every usenet discussion is ridiculous it opens the door to further abuse twpierce unix amherst edu tim pierce of course how does one determine whether a group requests the service a flat majority of posters voting in favor a positive margin of votes or what no one speaks for a newsgroup i m not convinced by the arguments that an anonymous posting service for all newsgroups is inherently a bad idea simply because it s a diversion from the status quo since the status quo previously permitted anonymous posting to no newsgroups any anonymous posting service would reject the status quo hartman ulogic uucp richard m hartman writes it is facist to suggest that a newsgroup is best able to decide whether it wants to allow anonymous postings instead of having them forced upon them by an service administrator ogil quads uchicago edu brian w ogilvie the service provides a mechanism for forwarding mail to the original poster since most usenet readers don t know john smith from jane doe except by their opinions and their address the effect of having an anonymous posting to which mail replies can be directed is minimal except for those who personally know the poster and the lack of anonymity could be serious any mechanism like this is liable to abuse but the benefits as well as the costs must be weighed limiting the service to alt groups or specific groups would not help those who want advice on sensitive issues in more professional newsgroups from tarl sw stratus com tarl neustaedter an additional point is that some of us find anonimity in technical matters to be profoundly offensive anonimity in different forums has different meanings if i get a phone call from someone who won t identify himself i hang up if i get u s mail with no return address it goes into the garbage unopened if someone accosts me in the street while wearing a mask i back away carefully and expecting violence in a technical discussion anonimity means that the individual isn t willing to associate himself with the matter being discussed which discredits his utterances and makes listening to them a waste of time anonimity leads to fun psych experiments the literature is filled with all the various things that people will do anonymously that they won t otherwise including one notorious study involving torture that would not have passed today s ethical standards fun stuff in any case fine leave us out of it from jbuck forney berkeley edu joe buck you obviously have never submitted an article to a refereed journal where you will receive anonymous reviews through a server the editor that behaves much like the one in finland e g you may reply and the editor will maintain the anonymity your comparison of someone who wants to express him herself on a technical issue anonymously with a person who approaches you on a dark street with a ski mask is just emotionally overwrought nonsense such posters pose no physical threat to you jik mit edu j kamens it seems obvious to me that the default should be not to allow anonymous postings in a newsgroup the usenet has always operated on the principle that the status quo should be kept unless there s a large number of people who want to change it if someone really needs to post a message anonymous in a newsgroup in which this usually isn t done they can usually find someone on the net to do this for them they don t need an automated service to do it and the automated service is by its nature incapable of making the judgment call necessary to decide whether a particular posting really needs to be anonymous from twpierce unix amherst edu tim pierce for any newsgroup you name i bet i can envision a scenario involving a need for secrecy if an accurate content based filter of each anonymous posting could be devised to screen out those that don t require secrecy wonderful but it can t be done from lhp daimi aau dk lasse hiller e petersen if a newsgroup wants to be noise and nuisance free then it should call for moderation this should happen on a per newsgroup basis and not as a general usenet ban on anonymous postings of course one principle of moderation might be to keep out all anonymous postings and could be achieved automatically it would still be moderation personally i would prefer moderation criteria being based on actual content david a clunie dclunie pax tpa com au if a group doesn t want to receive certain posts it should become moderated there are clearly defined mechanisms on non alt groups for this to take place an automated moderator excluding posts from certain eg anonymous sites or individuals could easily be established if anyone wants to take such a draconian approach then they are welcome to do so and good luck to them i doubt if i will be reading their group from dave frackit uucp dave ratcliffe what possible need would someone have for posting anonymously to a sci group sure most adults are willing to post under their own names why would they want to hide behind an anonymous posting service ashamed of what they have to say or just trying to rile people without fear of being identified anonymous posting have their place in certain groups if i or anyone else needs to tell you what those groups are then you ve been on another planet breathing exotic gases for too long from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu it s bloody fascinating that all the proponents of unimpeded universal anon posting access can t seem to find any middle ground at all why is there such a perception of absolutism where does this instant gratification syndrome come from i want anon access and i want it now who are the control freaks here from acearl leo bsuvc bsu edu remember this is a newsgroup for posters writing about scientific issues anonymous discussion of scientific issues leads to bad science from noring netcom com jon noring though many have personal philosophical arguments against anonymous posters their arguments have not been compelling enough to convince me that omni newsgroup anonymous posting should be banned or severely restricted though i cannot prove it it seems to me that those who do not like anonymous posting in principle do so for reasons that are personal read psychological discomfort rather than for reasons related to maintaining the integrity of usenet remember it is impossible to be able to ascertain all the conceivable and legitimate motives for anonymous posting to newsgroups one normally would not deem to be sensitive in general i fear even letting newsgroup readers vote on either allowing or not allowing anonymous posting since a priori they cannot know all the motives of legitimate posters and i do not believe that any system should ever be instituted that would inhibit the posting of legitimate and informative posts lestat wixer cactus org lyle j mackey writes i personally don t believe that pseudonymous postings are appropriate in a serious discussion area if there is a legitimate reason for concealing the posters identity perhaps but simply because they re not so sure if they want their name attached doesn t qualify as legitimate in my book oh and if you can come up with a legitimate purpose for anonymous postings please enlighten me sderby crick ssctr bcm tmc edu stuart p derby three of our the u s s founding fathers madison hamilton and jay seemed to think anonymous posting was ok the federalist papers were originally printed in new york newspapers with authorship attributed to publius i wonder if you would find their purpose legitimate what should system operators do with anonymous postings from emcguire intellection com ed mcguire i would like to know how to junk all articles posted by the anonymous service currently being discussed ideally i would actually tell my feed site not to feed me articles posted by the anonymous service assuming the c news performance release what is a simple way to accomplish this or where should i look to learn how to do it myself from dclunie pax tpa com au david clunie that s a bit draconian isn t it have your users unanimously decided that they would like you to do this or have you decided for them from emcguire intellection com ed mcguire good question nobody has decided i have no definite plan to do this just wanted the technical data carl kleinpaste karl kleinpaste godiva nectar cs cmu edu were i to be in the position of offering such a service again my promises of protection of anonymity would be limited not on the basis of personal opinion of what gets posted but on the basis of postings which disrupt the smooth operation of the usenet the most obvious and direct recourse would be to out the abusive individual less drastic possibilities exist the software supports a fire extinguisher by which individuals can be prevented from posting john iastate edu john hascall since when is usenet a democracy if someone wants to run an anonymous service that s their business if you want to put that host in your killfile that s your business if a newsadmin wants to blanket drop all postings from that site that s between them and the other people at that site if everyone ignores a service the service effectively doesn t exist from jik athena mit edu jonathan i kamens nntp servers that allow posting from anyone are not a service to the net they do the net a disservice terminal servers have the same problems as open nntp servers they allow people who want to do illegal immoral unethical things on the internet to do so without accountability there are by now public access sites all over this country if not all over the world that allow very inexpensive access to the usenet and the internet there is no reason for nntp servers to allow anyone to post messages through them and there is no reason for terminal servers to allow anyone to connect to them and then make outbound connections through them perhaps when it was harder to get to the internet or the usenet open servers could be justified but not now jbotz mtholyoke edu jurgen botz i think that what these points show clearly is that an anonymous posting service has a great deal of responsibility both towards its clients and towards the net as a whole such a service should imho have a set of well defined rules and a contract that its clients should sign under the terms of which they are assured anonymity from an anon penet fi is the problem that some are used to punishing posters who are upsetting in some vague way by complaining to the usually acquiescent sysadmin or organizations that the poster belongs to that surely is the most gutless approach to solving problems but my experience on the net shows that the same users who vilify anonymous postings are the first to write obsessively detailed grievances to the poster s supervisor when his or her tranquility is disturbed by some intrusive or subversive post or another anonymous postings prevent just this kind of intimidation from gandalf cyberspace org eric schilling the main point i would like to make here is that while we can go through and revise the news sw to reject anon posts to technical newsgroups or some such thing i think the attempt will prove futile each attempt to modify news can result in a changed approach by anon service providers to thwart the change i think this would be pointless from julf penet fi johan helsingius i have tried to stay out of this discussion and see where the discussion leads but now i rally feel like i have to speak up i have repeatedly made clear that i do block users if they continue their abuse after having been warned in many cases the users have taken heed of the warning and stopped and in some cases even apologized in public and when the warning has not had the desired effect i have blocked a number of users i have also blocked access to groups where the readership has taken a vote to ban anonymous postings although i feel changing the newsgroup status to moderated is the only permanent solution for newsgroups that want to formalize discussion red redpoll neoucom edu richard e depew does this mean that you are volunteering to issue a request for discussion to ban anonymous postings or to moderate each of the newsgroups that your server can reach i don t think so but this illustrates the trouble that your server is causing please listen to the consensus of the news administrators in this group any newsgroup should be consulted before letting your server post messages to that group from c vm urz uni heidelberg de alexander eichener there is no pompous consensus of the news administrators here maybe you would like to invent one there is a sizeable number of people who are concerned about the possible and to a minor extent about the actual abuse of the server as it is configured now these concerns are respectable johan is dealing with them there are some few who rage with foam before their mouth and condemn the service altogether and a number who defend it pointing out like kate gregory that even a group like misc kids can benefit from pseudonymous postings from julf penet fi johan helsingius i have answered a lot of personal mail related to server abuse and as a result of that blocked a number of abusive users i have also withdrawn the service from several newsgroups where the users have taken a vote on the issue i have not made any comments on news admin policy partly because the newly implemented password feature as a emergency measure against a security hole has kept me really busy answering user queries the last two weeks and partly because i feel it is not for me to justify the service but for the users the problem with news admin policy is that the readership is rather elective representing people whith a strong interest in centralised control from hartman ulogic uucp richard m hartman this seems to be a rather bigoted attitude i would consider that this group is for anyone who wishes to discuss how the net should be controlled saying that we only have an interest in centralized control is a clear indication of bias you are perfectly welcome to join in the discussions here to promote your views on control jbuck ohm berkeley edu this whole debate is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing because even if you all decide to ban anonymous posting servers it is not enforceable the only people who conceivably could enforce retrictions are those that control the international links policy changes should be made by cooperation not by attempting to dictate you need to persuade those who run the services to act like this through friendly persuasion not by trying to beat them over the head with a stick especially a stick you don t even have spp zabriskie berkeley edu steve pope i am finding this bias against pseudonymity boring our friend posting through penet has a point the old guard would like to keep their network the way it always has been and this new thing these pseudonymous servers cuts into their turf so they whine and bitch about it and every time there s the slightest abuse such as somebody s sig being too long they try to parlay that into an argument against pseudonymity i ll go on record as saying three cheers for the admins at anon servers like penet pax and n kbt and for all the access service providers who are willing to preserve their clients privacy and a pox on those who try to defeat and restrict pseudonymity mimir stein u washington edu al billings i wouldn t help people get rid of anon postings as a group if you don t like what someone says then you put that anon address in your kill file not all of them of course if and when i get an anon site going i m just going to assign fake names like jsmith instead of anon to avoid most of the hassles you ll never know it is anonymous will you from anne alcor concordia ca anne bennett i must admit to some astonishment at this argument i see the value of anonymous postings under some circumstances yet believe strongly that these should be identified as such so that people who do not wish to read material from people who won t identify themselves don t have to i fail to see what good you would be accomplishing and indeed surmise that you will cause many people inconvenience and annoyance by hiding the anonymity of postings from your anonymous site would you care to justify where the hell you get the gall to try to prevent people from effectively filtering their news as they see fit from dclunie pax tpa com au david clunie i thought i was out of reach here in australia too unfortunately one of the us sites involved in the us aus feed complained to the australian academic reasearch network through whom my site is connected not about anything in particular just the concept of anonymous mail having no redeeming features and consuming a narrow bandwidth link with which i can t argue and that was that stop the service or face disconnection i consider the demise of my service to have been rather unfortunate and i wish the finnish remailer luck it is a pity that there are very few if any similar services provided with in the us i guess that s the benefit of having a constitution that guarantees one freedom of speech and a legal and political system that conspires to subvert it in the name of the public good what is going on with anon penet fi run by j helsingius from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu funny how beating the rest of the usenet over the head with a stick is ok if it s anon penet fi and universal anon access but somehow people on the other side of the same equation not even arguing to shut it off entirely but rather just to have some control applied to the abuses that manifest themselves aren t allowed to do that i have written to johan several times in the last couple of weeks he used to reply to me quite readily after all i was the source of the software as originally delivered to him he used to be downright prompt about replying to me funny now he s being an impolite bastard who doesn t answer mail at all even when it consists of really very civil queries from julf penet fi johan helsingius in your mail you told me you sent me one or more messages on feb th feb th and th the server was down and the flood of mail that resulted from the server coming up again crashed my own mail host the problem was aggregated by an abusive user sending thousands of messages to another user filling up that users mailbox the bounce messages ended up in my mailbox overflowing my local disk as well i can only suppose that your message got lost in that hassle as i have tried to answer as much as possible of the anon related messages i get from routine mis addessed messages to complaints about the service on the average i spend hours per day answering anon related messages from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu why is it that everybody else has to put up with the impoliteness and insensitivity of the misuse of anon penet fi whose definitions of polite and sense apply and why why is universal anon access considered to be within the realm of this fuzzy concept of politeness in the first place i think johan has long since crossed the line into being a rude bastard and i told him so in private mail a little while ago at this point i deeply regret a having created an anonymous system supporting newsgroup and b having given the code to johan i didn t copyright it but i thought that some concept of politeness and good sense might follow it to new homes interesting that johan s ideas of politeness and good sense seem to have nearly no interesection with mine i could even cope with universal anon access if johan would be willing to engage in abuse control but somehow that seems to be outside the range of reality from julf penet fi johan helsingius there is no way for me to convey how sad and upset your message made me i do to some extent understand your feelings but it still feels really bad running the server requires getting used to a lot of flames but mindlessly abusive hate mail is so much easier to deal with than something like this as i do respect and value your views and opinions to a high degree no i m not asking for sympathy i just wanted you to know that i am really giving your views quite a lot of weight when i asked for the software i was actually only going to provide the service to scandinavian users but a lot of people requested that i keep the service open to the international community i now realize that i ought to have contacted you at that point to ask how you feel about me using your stuff in such a context again i really want to apologise and i will replace the remaining few pieces of code thet still stem from your system unfortunately there is no way to remove the ideas and structure i got from you again i am really sorry that the results of your work ended up being used in a way that you don t approve of and i will be giving a lot of hard thought to the possibility of shutting down the server alltogether from karl kleinpaste cs cmu edu i think i m feeling especially rude and impolite if it s good for johan it s good for me after all he didn t ask the greater usenet whether universal anon access was a good idea he just did it yes i m a seriously rude pain in the ass now and i think i ll arm the usenet death penalty slightly modified not for strategic whole site attack but tactical assault just an anon penet fi destruction only outside alt too let s say to parrot this line people have been doing things like the udp that is cancelling others postings for years no one could ever stop them and it s only politeness and good sense that has prevented them up to now in fact i have people who have expressed privately the desire and ability to arm the udp ps no in fact there are not newsadmins ready to arm the udp it would be amusing to know how many people gulped hard when they read that though i don t see it as any different from johan s configuration pps now that i ve calmed some fears by the above ps there are newsadmins ready to arm the udp they ve asked for my code i haven t sent it yet only one site would be necessary to bring anon penet fi to a screeching halt anyone can implement the udp on their own if they care to politeness and good sense prevents them from doing so i wonder how long before one form of impoliteness brings on another form from julf penet fi johan helsingius it would be trivially easy to bring anon penet fi to a screeching halt in fact it has happened a couple of times already but as we are talking threats here let me make one as well a very simple one if somebody uses something like the udp or maliciously brings down anon penet fi by some other means it will stay down but i will let the users know why and name the person who did it ok as somebody said on this thread you have to take personal responsibility for your actions right from avs ccc amdahl com atul v salgaonkar i am very grateful and appreciative of this service courtesey of penet fi some important questions about my personal life career job were resolved due to kind help of other people who had been thru similar situations in return i have also replied to anon postings where i thought i could make a positive contribution in general anon service is a great in my opinion although like any tool some people will not use it responsibly i suggest that it should be kept alive wasting bandwidth is less important than saving lives i think from us mmm serc m com elisa j collins i have been informed that the anonymous posting service to many newsgroups has been turned off as a result

via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this

sci.crypt	re text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption clipper csrc ncsl nist gov clipper chip announcement writes the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement a nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption devices with built in trapdoors just like the feds wanted for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement bla bla protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals indeed and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this doesn t say much there are many incredibly weak encryption algorithms in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically except from the government at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals nope the criminals won t be stupid enough to use the new chip they ll use something secure this technology provides only means to intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to use it agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap that is the government has the keys it doesn t matter much if they are in one or in two of its hands the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans correct it does however provide those americans with the false sense of privacy devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings if the screening is not public it cannot be trusted some people do not trust des even today after all the examinations only because some parts of its design were kept secret the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology so they ll use a different technology to hide their illegal activities so will those law abiding citizens who do not trust their government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes except from the government the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products huh later it says that the new technology will be export restricted since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law in short the new technology can protect the law abiding citizen s privacy from the casual snooper it cannot protect him from the government if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys or to bribe the people who handle them etc prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans correct however it does not provide them that much privacy as it claims q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks two candidates the nsa and the mafia q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today that is trust us while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow security through obscurity system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities if it s not entirely open to public examination it cannot be trusted besides who can prove that the devices used for examination and the ones built into your phones will be the same q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the the nsa and the fbi q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative why did they forget the academia q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them doesn t this smell to monopolism q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future like the mafia q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices this is the main question why was it buried at the end a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow we ll see mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one trust us the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have in short if we decide to outlaw strong crypto we ll tell you effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a since the us government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions and since the us constitutions guarantees the right to every american to bear arms why is not every american entitled as a matter of right to an unbreakable commercial encryption product a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism bullshit the proposed technology provides a false sense of security encryption devices with built in capabilities for breaking the encryption does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto and is a step to outlaw strong crypto q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will leave the export controls on strong crypto devices ok i m not american it s not my

phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products

sci.crypt	re inventing crypto policy an eff statement april initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposal the clinton administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of americans the first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption and law enforcement issues posed by new technology however eff is very concerned that the administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any public comment or discussion has been allowed apparently the administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the national security agency the so called clipper chip is an bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor two separate escrow agents would store users keys and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant the encryption scheme used is to be classified but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products this proposal raises a number of serious concerns first the administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry the nsa developed clipper chip may not be the most secure product other vendors or developers may have better schemes furthermore we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the clipper or any other chips rather independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards second an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested yet the administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified eff believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open the public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent expert scrutiny third while the use of the use of a split key dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted what will give people confidence in the safety of their keys does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual s fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries these are but a few of the many questions the administrations proposal raised but fails to answer in sum the administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security however the clipper chip solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry and not be adopted before the discussion even begins details of the proposal escrow the bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom hold bits of each key the manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents a key is tied to the device however not the person using it upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents according to the presidential directive just issued the attorney general will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents some in the administration have suggested that one non law enforcement federal agency perhaps the federal reserve and one non governmental organization could be chosen but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet classified algorithm and the possibility of back doors the administration claims that there are no back doors means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents and that the president will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm in order to prove this administration sources are interested in arranging for an all star crypto cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the algorithm for trap doors the results of the investigation would then be made public the clipper chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole source secret contract between the national security agency and two private firms vlsi and mycotronx nsa work on this plan has been underway for about four years the manufacturing contract was let months ago government as market driver in order to get a market moving and to show that the government believes in the security of this system the feds will be the first big customers for this product users will include the fbi secret service vp al gore and maybe even the president at today s commerce department press briefing a number of people asked this question though why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors comprehensive policy inquiry the administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection encryption and law enforcement the items to be considered include export controls on encryption technology and the fbi s digital telephony proposal it appears that the this inquiry will be conducted

pub nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products

sci.crypt	an open letter to mr clinton i m quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging american freedoms the clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography to do so is tantamount to regulating acceptable speech and is blatantly unconstitutional perhaps we should rename this year in honor of such an illustrious proposal let the crappy chip live in infamy and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure i am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures the u s government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this and i call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal the administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals it seems to me that u s diplomatic communications should be tappable by the u n whenever any countries produce a warrant to the u n in fact i think we should stop paying the nsa billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason these actions violate the sovereignity of international law i hope mr clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here but if he isn t it s a modest and reasonable proposal so he should find merit with it nevertheless cryptography is neutral technology if everybody has strong cryptography including policemen bureacrats businessmen housewives thugs and hoodlums we have a sustainable equilibrium anything less is an unworkable anti egaltarian arrangement intrinsically antithetical to american freedoms and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality we don t need to compromise on issues of freedom for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans for too long our government has demonstrated itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protecting americans since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law it is not possible for the federal government to act quickly or develop consistent comprehensive policies period and even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible it would only be an efficient way to deprive american citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights the administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone esp on this issue the government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices no such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent to a veiled threat which i don t appreciate this kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism i will trade threats for threats and violation for violation the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done if the administration did say this it would find itself impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential established entrenched and explicit constitutional privacy guarantees the administration would have no legal standing whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast segments of the population nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product the u s comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government is saying just that take your chips and give them to nsa employees as christmas bonuses we can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please and we will make any chips we please and we will send any bit pattern over our data highways we please and if you try to stop us you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness privacy vs law enforcement there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition this is an outright dingaling denning lie the two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise americans are about to discover ways through the use of technology to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and unrepresentative government ld longs lance colostate edu

sci answers and news answers every days contents in mathematical terms what is a private key cryptosystem what is an attack what s the advantage of formulating all this mathematically why is the one time pad secure what s a ciphertext only attack what s a known plaintext attack what s a chosen plaintext attack in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks what s a key guessing attack what s entropy in mathematical terms what is a private key cryptosystem a private key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system e and a decryption system d the encryption system e is a collection of functions e k indexed by keys k mapping some set of plaintexts p to some set of ciphertexts c similarly the decryption system d is a collection of functions d k such that d k e k p p for every plaintext p that is succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key index as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext into ciphertext such systems wherein the same key value is used to encrypt and decrypt are also known as symmetric cryptoystems what is an attack in intuitive terms a passive attack on a cryptosystem is any method of starting with some information about plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts under some unknown key and figuring out more information about the plaintexts it s possible to state mathematically what this means here we go fix functions f g and h of n variables fix an encryption system e and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys an attack on e using g assuming f giving h with probability p is an algorithm a with a pair f g of inputs and one output h such that there is probability p of computing h h p p n if we have f f p p n and g g e k p e k p n note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector k p p n the attack is trivial or pointless if there is probability at least p of computing h h p p n if f f p p n and g g c c n here c c n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts and have no particular relation to p p n in other words an attack is trivial if it doesn t actually use the encryptions e k p e k p n an attack is called one ciphertext if n two ciphertext if n and so on what s the advantage of formulating all this mathematically in basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure read part we keep saying a strong cryptosystem must have this property but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem is strong in contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely formulate and if possible prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong we say for example that a cryptosystem is secure against all passive attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system as defined above is too slow to be practical if we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any passive cryptanalytic technique if we can reduce this statement to some well known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem isn t easy to break other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical definition again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions we re making and prove that they produce the desired results we can figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used properly it just means that the assumptions are valid the same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too the cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumptions often he can try to construct a proof of security for a system see where the proof fails and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis why is the one time pad secure by definition the one time pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintexts ciphertexts and keys are all strings say byte strings of some length m and e k p is just the sum let s say the exclusive or of k and p it is easy to prove mathematically that there are no nontrivial single ciphertext attacks on the one time pad assuming a uniform distribution of keys note that we don t have to assume a uniform distribution of plaintexts here s the proof let a be an attack i e an algorithm taking two inputs f g and producing one output h with some probability p that h h p whenever f f p and g g e k p i e g g k p then because the distribution of k is uniform and independent of p the distribution of k p must also be uniform and independent of p but also the distribution of c is uniform and independent of p hence there is probability exactly p that h h p whenever f f p and g g c over all p and c thus a fortiori a is trivial on the other hand the one time pad is not secure if a key k is used for more than one plaintext i e there are nontrivial multiple ciphertext attacks so to be properly used a key k must be thrown away after one encryption the key is also called a pad this explains the name one time pad what s a ciphertext only attack in the notation above a ciphertext only attack is one where f is constant given only some information g e k p e k p n about n ciphertexts the attack has to have some chance of producing some information h p p n about the plaintexts the attack is trivial if it has just as good a chance of producing h p p n when given g c c n for random c c n for example say g c c and say h p is the first bit of p we can easily write down an attack the guessing attack which simply guesses that h p is this attack is trivial because it doesn t use the ciphertext it has a fifty fifty chance of guessing correctly no matter what on the other hand there is an attack on rsa which produces one bit of information about p with success using c if it is fed a random c then the success rate drops to so this is a nontrivial attack what s a known plaintext attack the classic known plaintext attack has f p p p g c c c c and h p p depending only on p in other words given two ciphertexts c and c and one decryption p the known plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption p note that known plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature as producing information about the key but this is pointless the cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him decrypt further messages what s a chosen plaintext attack a chosen plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical series of active attacks on a cryptosystem attacks where the cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor these attacks don t fit into our model of passive attacks explained above anyway a chosen plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and look at the corresponding ciphertext then repeat until he has figured out how to decrypt any message more absurd examples of this sort of attack are the chosen key attack and chosen system attack a much more important form of active attack is a message corruption attack where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a way as to make a useful change in the plaintext there are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks for instance automatically encrypting any plaintext p as t e k h t r p r p where t is a time key sequence number chosen anew for each message r is a random number and h is a one way hash function here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive or in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks consider the following known plaintext attack we are given some plaintexts p p n and ciphertexts c c n we re also given a ciphertext c n we run through every key k when we find k such that e k p i c i for every i n we print d k c n if n is big enough that only one key works this attack will succeed on valid inputs all the time while it will produce correct results only once in a blue moon for random inputs thus this is a nontrivial attack its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many possible keys what s a key guessing attack what s entropy say somebody is using the one time pad but isn t choosing keys randomly and uniformly from all m bit messages as he was supposed to for our security proof in fact say he s known to prefer keys which are english words then a cryptanalyst can run through all english words as possible keys this attack will often succeed and it s much faster than a brute force search of the entire keyspace we can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its entropy this number e is the number of real bits of information of the key a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within e guesses e is defined as the sum of p k log p k where p k is the probability of key k

encryption has been shown to be very easy to break the method uses xor with two repeating key streams a typed password and a byte wide counter initialized to the password length full descriptions are given in bennett ben and bergen and caelli ber chris galas writes someone awhile back was looking for a way to decrypt wordperfect document files and i think i have a solution there is a software company named accessdata east south orem ut that has a software package that will decrypt any wordperfect lotus quatro pro ms excel and paradox files the cost of the package is steep prices but if you think your pw key is less than characters or char give them a call and ask for the free demo disk the demo disk will decrypt files that have a char or less pw key how do i break a vigenere repeated key cipher a repeated key cipher where the ciphertext is something like the plaintext xor keykeykeykey and so on is called a vigenere cipher if the key is not too long and the plaintext is in english do the following discover the length of the key by counting coincidences see gaines gai sinkov sin trying each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those bytes which are equal if the two ciphertext portions have used the same key something over of the bytes will be equal if they have used different key then less than will be equal assuming random bit bytes of key covering normal ascii text the smallest displacement which indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key shift the text by that length and xor it with itself this removes the key and leaves you with text xored with itself since english has about bit of real information per byte streams of text xored together has bits of info per bit byte providing plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption and in fact one stream of text xored with itself has just bit per byte if the key is short it might be even easier to treat this as a standard polyalphabetic substitution all the old cryptanalysis texts show how to break those it s possible with those methods in the hands of an expert if there s only ten times as much text as key see for example gaines gai sinkov sin how do i send encrypted

privacy enhanced mail it is described in rfcs through to join the pem mailing list contact pem dev request tis com there is a beta version of pem being tested at the time of this writing there are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting mail pgp and ripem both are available by ftp each has its own newsgroup alt security pgp and alt security ripem each has its own faq as well pgp is most commonly used outside the usa since it uses the rsa algorithm without a license and rsa s patent is valid only or at least primarily in the usa ripem is most commonly used inside the usa since it uses the rsaref which is freely available within the usa but not available for shipment outside the usa since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of the message pgp used idea ripem uses des and rsa for encrypting the message key they should be able to interoperate freely although there have been repeated calls for each to understand the other s formats and algorithm choices no interoperation is available at this time as far as we know is the unix crypt command secure no see ree there is a program available called cbw crypt breaker s workbench which can be used to do ciphertext only attacks on files encrypted with crypt one source for cbw is ftpcb how do i use compression with encryption a number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by some simple encryption method e g xor with a repeated key unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible inputs for all practical purposes it s impossible to describe the typical english text beyond coarse characteristics such as single letter frequencies you can build up more and more sophisticated models of your inputs but if the enemy has a slightly more accurate model he ll be able to find some redundancy in your compressed output note that nearly all practical compression schemes unless they have been designed with cryptography in mind produce output that actually starts off with high redundancy for example the output of unix compress begins with a well known three byte magic number that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis this is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a bad idea it just has to be done very very carefully and by no means removes the need for strong encryption compression after encryption is silly is there an unbreakable cipher yes the one time pad is unbreakable see part unfortunately the one time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as plaintext of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful rather it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is expected to remain valid what does random mean in cryptography cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom number generator than most applications for a source of bits to be cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of th through n st bits for all n up to the lifetime of the source a software generator also known as pseudo random has the function of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently random bits this seed must be large enough not to be guessed by the opponent ideally it should also be truly random perhaps generated by a hardware random number source those who have sparcstation workstations could for example generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of entropy by not connecting anything to it for example cat dev audio compress foo gives a file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in it one can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo random string when looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy it is important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it looks complicated to a human it must be random for example disk operation completion times sound like they might be unpredictable to many people but a spinning disk is much like a clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy what is the unicity point a k a unicity distance see sha the unicity distance is an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number of ciphertext bits used ciphertexts significantly longer than this can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment this is used to back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext only cryptanalysis ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have multiple equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security from the opponent s difficulty choosing the correct one unicity distance like all statistical or information theoretic measures does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives probabilistic results namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible keys are tried for the decryption working cryptologists don t normally deal with unicity distance as such instead they directly determine the likelihood of events of interest let the unicity distance of a cipher be d characters if fewer than d ciphertext characters have been intercepted then there is not enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of possible keys des has a unicity distance of characters which is less than ciphertext blocks each block corresponds to ascii characters this may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work required to find the key after approximately d characters have been intercepted in fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used in discussing unicity distance like other measures such as key size unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if it s too small but doesn t guarantee security if it s high few practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis all manner of characteristics might serve as entering wedges to crack some cipher messages however similar information theoretic considerations are occasionally useful for example to determine a recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and information theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most promising directions unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified even the seminal work of alan turing see koz for some insight into the possibilities see kul and goo what is key management and why is it important one of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption of course one would assume that the cia does not make a habit of telling mossad about its cryptosystems but mossad probably finds out anyway repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thus especially in modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are transferred both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic key management refers to the distribution authentication and handling of keys a publicly accessible example of modern key management technology is the stu iii secure telephone unit which for classified use employs individual coded crypto ignition keys and a central key management center operated by nsa there is a hierarchy in that certain ciks are used by authorized cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and to perform installation maintenance functions such as the reporting of lost ciks this should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem for public key systems there are several related issues many having to do with whom do you trust can i use pseudo random or chaotic numbers as a key stream chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generators perhaps the simplest example is a linear congruential sequence one of the most popular types of random number generators where there is no obvious dependence between seeds and outputs unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a high enough dimension show up as a regular lattice mathematically this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for cryptanalysts to exploit more complicated generators have more complicated structure which is why they make interesting pictures but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all see knu exercise ree and boy what is the correct frequency list for english letters there are three answers to this question each slightly deeper than the one before you can find the first answer in various books namely a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of english text of course any such list will be correctly computed but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken the second answer is that the question doesn t make sense what do you mean by english letters the english language is not a fixed finite closed object that can be exactly characterized it has changed over time it is different between different authors any particular message will have different statistics from those of the language as a whole the third answer is that yes no particular message is going to have exactly the same characteristics as english in general but for all reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won t matter in fact there s an entire field called bayesian statistics other buzzwords are maximum entropy methods and maximum likelihood estimation which studies questions like what s the chance that a text with these letter frequencies is in english and comes up with reasonably robust answers so make your own list from your own samples of english text it will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly what is the enigma for a project in data security we are looking for sources of information about the german enigma code and how it was broken by the british during wwii see wel dea koz hod kah how do i shuffle cards card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of values using a random or pseudo random function all possible output permutations of this process should be equally likely to do this you need a random function modran x which will produce a uniformly distributed random integer in the interval x given that function you can shuffle with the following c code assuming arrlth is the length of array arr and swap interchanges values at the two addresses given for n arrlth n n swap arr modran n arr n modran x can not be achieved exactly with a simple ranno x since ranno s interval may not be divisible by x although in most cases the error will be very small to cover this case one can take ranno s modulus mod x call that number y and if ranno returns a value less than y go back and get another ranno value can i foil s w pirates by encrypting my cd rom someone will frequently express the desire to publish a cd rom with possibly multiple pieces of software perhaps with each encrypted separately and will want to use different keys for each user perhaps even good for only a limited period of time in order to avoid piracy as far as we know this is impossible since there is nothing in standard pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the keyboard if there were such an identification then the cd rom could be encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in part on the unique identifier however in this case the cd rom is one of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose if the cd rom is to be encrypted once and then mass produced there must be a key or set of keys for that encryption produced at some stage in the process that key is useable with any copy of the cd rom s data the pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the illegal copy can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers schneier chinet chi il us bruce schneier says accessdata of orem utah sells

is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break what is cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key the story begins when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted acquaintances he didn t trust the messengers so he replaced every a by a c every b by a d and so on through the alphabet only someone who knew the shift by rule could decipher his messages a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so that only certain people can see through the disguise cryptography is the art of creating and using cryptosystems cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptosystems seeing through the disguise even when you re not supposed to be able to cryptology is the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis the original message is called a plaintext the disguised message is called a ciphertext encryption means any procedure to convert plaintext into ciphertext decryption means any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms the algorithms are labelled the labels are called keys for instance caesar probably used shift by n encryption for several different values of n it s natural to say that n is the key here the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called recipients other people are enemies opponents interlopers eavesdroppers or third parties what references can i start with to learn cryptology for an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given in part are the best place to begin as they are in general concise authored by competent people and well written however these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has developed in the last years or so and are more abstract and mathematical than historical the codebreakers by kahn kah is encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up to the mid s introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines gai or sinkov sin this is recommended especially for people who want to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of many public researchers to problems in cryptology consequently several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared the book of denning den gives a good introduction to a broad range of security including encryption algorithms database security access control and formal models of security similar comments apply to the books of price davies pri and pfleeger pfl the books of konheim kon and meyer matyas mey are quite technical books both konheim and meyer were directly involved in the development of des and both books give a thorough analysis of des konheim s book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses of many classical cryptosystems meyer and matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and networks the books of rueppel rue and koblitz kob concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography how does one go about cryptanalysis classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern finding patience determination and luck the best available textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series frie it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for the most part gained through the attempted solution of given systems such experience is considered so valuable that some of the cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still classified modern public key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer or taking a discrete logarithm these are not the traditional fare of the cryptanalyst computational number theorists are some of the most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems what is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance in a nutshell if f x y and you know y and can compute f you can find x by trying every possible x that s brute force search example say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding ciphertext but doesn t know the key he can simply try encrypting the plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matches or decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is faster every well designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this brute force search is impractical advances in technology sometimes change what is considered practical for example des which has been in use for over years now has or about possible keys a computation with this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the mid s the situation is very different today given the dramatic decrease in cost per processor operation massively parallel machines threaten the security of des against brute force search some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge gar one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a brute force search of some manageably small space of possibilities what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned above the unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is probably strong a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests see for example cae a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks a system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect if a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily strong certainly not many weak cryptosystems looked good at first however sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathematical proof if joe can break this system then he can also solve the well known difficult problem of factoring integers see part failing that it s a crap shoot if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical cryptanalysis the enemy doesn t have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext for instance he might assume cribs stretches of probable plaintext if the crib is correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message or he might exploit isologs the same plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys thus he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he doesn t have a chance sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused the one time pad for example loses all security if it is used more than once even chosen plaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been employed see kah why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break some don t know any better often amateurs think they can design secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could do and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work needed to crack a system

differential cryptanalysis how was nsa involved in the design of des is des available in software is des available in hardware can des be used to protect classified information what are ecb cbc cfb and ofb encryption what is a product cipher a product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak operations such as substitution transposition modular addition multiplication and linear transformation a block cipher just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data bytes say all at once then goes on to the next block the notion of product ciphers is due to shannon sha examples of modern product ciphers include lucifer sor des nbs sp networks kam loki bro feal shi pes lai khufu and khafre me a the so called feistel ciphers are a class of product ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round lucifer des loki and feal are examples of feistel ciphers the following table compares the main parameters of several product ciphers cipher block length key bits number of rounds lucifer des loki feal x x pes what makes a product cipher secure nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is completely secure so in practice one begins by demonstrating that the cipher looks highly random for example the cipher must be nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the key meyer mey has shown that at least rounds of des are required to guarantee such a dependence in this sense a product cipher should act as a mixing function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear fashion the fixed per round substitutions of the product cipher are referred to as s boxes for example lucifer has s boxes and des has s boxes the nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these s boxes a list of partial design criteria for the s boxes of des which apply to s boxes in general may be found in brown bro and brickell et al bri what are some group theoretic properties of product ciphers let e be a product cipher that maps n bit blocks to n bit blocks let e k x be the encryption of x under key k then for any fixed k the map sending x to e k x is a permutation of the set of n bit blocks denote this permutation by p k the set of all n bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written s n the collection of all these permutations p k where k ranges over all possible keys is denoted e s n if e were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect e s n to generate a large subset of s n coppersmith and grossman cop have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group a n given a sufficient number of rounds the alternating group is half of the symmetric group it consists of all even permutations i e all permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps even and goldreich eve were able to extend these results to show that feistel ciphers can generate a n given a sufficient number of rounds the security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group theoretic properties of a cipher multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys k k there does not exist a third key k such that e k e k x e k x which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys k k is equal to a single encryption under the third key k if for every k k there exists a k such that eq is true then we say that e is a group this question of whether des is a group under this definition was extensively studied by sherman kaliski and rivest she in their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that des is not a group in fact des is not a group cam what can be proven about the security of a product cipher recall from above that p k is a permutation produced by e under some key k the goal of the designer of e is to ensure that p k appears to be a random element of s n the symmetric group let r be an element of s n selected randomly we will say that p k and r are indistinguishable if an observer given p k and r in some order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial time that is with time bounded resources the observer cannot determine which of the permutations is produced by e the optimal decision is no better than simply guessing luby and rackoff lub have shown that a class of feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean functions how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size there are four standard modes of operation and numerous non standard ones as well the standard modes of operation are defined in the u s department of commerce federal information processing standard fips published in see the question about ecb below for more details although they are defined for the des block cipher the modes of operation can be used with any block cipher can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication one may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation but one cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key and thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that key see ansi x and fips for a standard method of message authentication using des what exactly is des des is the u s government s data encryption standard a product cipher that operates on bit blocks of data using a bit key it is defined in fips which supersedes fips fips are federal information processing standards published by ntis des is identical to the ansi standard data encryption algorithm dea defined in ansi x what is triple des triple des is a product cipher which like des operates on bit data blocks there are several forms each of which uses the des cipher times some forms use two bit keys some use three the des modes of operation may also be used with triple des some people refer to e k d k e k x as triple des this method is defined in chapter of the ansi standard x financial institution key management and is intended for use in encrypting des keys and ivs for automated key distribution its formal name is encryption and decryption of a single key by a key pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as ede that standard says section key encrypting keys may be a single dea key or a dea key pair key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed e g the data protected by the key s has a long security life a key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single key others use the term triple des for e k d k e k x or e k e k e k x one of us carl ellison keeps advocating des triple use in the form e k tran e k tran e k compress x where each des instance has its own key and iv for cbc mode and tran has been posted on sci crypt it is a large block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on its own part what is differential cryptanalysis differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping ie any mapping which is based on a repeated round function the method was recently popularized by biham and shamir bih but coppersmith has remarked that the s boxes of des were optimized against this attack some years ago this method has proved effective against several product ciphers notably feal bi a differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts y y whose corresponding plaintexts x x satisfy a known difference d x x where is componentwise xor in the basic biham shamir attack such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for des substantially fewer pairs are required if des is truncated to or rounds in these cases the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs for full des this attack is impractical because it requires so many known plaintexts the work of biham and shamir on des revealed several startling observations on the algorithm most importantly if the key schedule was removed from des and a bit key was used the key could be recovered in less than steps thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to des further the s boxes of des are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential attack adi shamir is quoted to say nytimes oct i would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the des so that the basic design was weakened how was nsa involved in the design of des according to kinnucan kin tuchman a member of the group that developed des at ibm is quoted as saying we developed the des algorithm entirely within ibm using ibmers the nsa did not dictate a single wire tuchman and meyer another developer of des spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in lucifer they then spent two years strengthening lucifer their basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation and key scheduling functions ibm has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the nsa the nsa told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms explains tuchman on the other hand a document called involvement of the nsa in the development of des unclassified summary of the united states select committee on intelligence printed in the ieee communications magazine p states in the development of des nsa convinced ibm that a reduced keysize was sufficient indirectly assisted in the development of the s box structures and certified that the final des algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the nsa the article further states that the nsa did not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of meyer and tuchman presented above is des available in software several people have made des code available via ftp see part for pathnames stig ostholm ftpso bsd

cryptogram association and how do i get in touch is rsa patented what about the voynich manuscript what is the national security agency nsa the nsa is the official security body of the u s government it was given its charter by president truman in the late s and has continued research in cryptology till the present the nsa is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world governments in general have always been prime employers of cryptologists the nsa probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice but for reasons of national security almost all information about the nsa is classified bamford s book bamfd gives a history of the people and operations of the nsa the following quote from massey mas highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors without doubt the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology for only about years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology there have been and will continue to be conflicts between these two research communities open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals but can a government agency charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government s code breakers one might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would force all governments to behave like stimson s gentlemen but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most scientific fields the wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology but rather that these conflicts at least those of which we are aware have been so few and so mild what are the us export regulations in a nutshell there are two government agencies which control export of encryption software one is the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce authorized by the export administration regulations ear another is the office of defense trade controls dtc in the state department authorized by the international traffic in arms regulations itar as a rule of thumb bxa which works with cocom has less stringent requirements but dtc which takes orders from nsa wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa the newsgroup misc legal computing carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what people think about those laws and many other complex issues which go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci crypt make sure to consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in jail if you are lucky your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at least heard of the itar what is tempest tempest is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer equipment it was created in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation e g from a crt at quite a distance and with little effort needless to say encryption doesn t do much good if the cleartext is available this way what are the beale ciphers and are they a hoax thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for corrections the story in a pamphlet by j b ward goes thomas jefferson beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass of treasure and buried it in bedford county virginia leaving three ciphers with an innkeeper the ciphers describe the location contents and intended beneficiaries of the treasure ward gives a decryption of the second cipher contents called b it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the declaration of independence doi as key b and b are unsolved many documents have been tried as the key to b aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve b by various means with an eye toward splitting the treasure the beale cypher association p o box beaver falls pa you can get the ciphers from the rec puzzles faql by including the line send index in a message to netlib peregrine com and following the directions there are apparently several different versions of the cipher floating around the correct version is based on the pamphlet says john king kingj hpcc corp hp com some believe the story is a hoax kruh kru gives a long list of problems with the story gillogly gil decrypted b with the doi and found some unexpected strings including abfdefghiijklmmnohpp hammer president of the beale cypher association agrees that this string couldn t appear by chance but feels there must be an explanation gwyn sci crypt expert is unimpressed with this string what is the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch the aca is

sci.crypt	re secret algorithm re clipper chip and crypto key escrow interestingly enough in designing the escrow we may want to use some rather unusual technology such as sealed boxes of paper or destructive read memory rather than typical computer databases which is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys the greatest danger of the escrow database if it were kept on disk would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out you can design lots of protection but with enough corruption a complete copy is always possible storing it on paper or something very hard to copy at once may actually make sense or a medium that can t be copied for example something with very slow access times or which leaves a destructive trail if it is even read of course then it s hard to backup however i think the consequences of no backup the data is not there when a warrant comes are worse than the consequences of a secret backup an audit trail that reveals when data has been access that can t be erased by the humans involved is also necessary brad templeton clarinet communications corp sunnyvale ca

sci.crypt	clipper some new thoughts i d desparately prefer it if we didn t rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time that s especially true for sci crypt for that matter i ve created alt privacy clipper since the traffic is appearing in many different groups right now i m going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan hence my followup to sci crypt frankly if you re not an absolutist your feelings may turn on some of these issues for example with an bit key simply splitting it into two bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes because it means that if just one repository is shall we say overly pliable a would be eavesdropper would need to recover just more bits of key i need not point out in this newsgroup that that s pretty easy to do by exhaustive search a slightly more complex scheme xor ing the key with a random number and then with its complement would produce two bit subkeys neither of which is useful alone that variant is much more resistant to attack clearly one can get even more sophisticated to protect the subkeys even more other thoughts some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary but the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key double encrypted with the escrow repositories public keys for that matter they could do that only with session keys and have no back door at all in that case the fbi would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted this would answer many of the objections along the lines of how do you make sure they stop we can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door have the switch do the tap but with a digitally signed record of the time phone number etc of the call that provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant i can suggest other variations too suppose each clipper chip had public key pairs each would be used times after which you d need more keying material not a bad idea in any event this could be used to enforce time limits or rather usage limits on each warrant the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn t last for very long i suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure apart from the obvious why push a weak algorithm when you ve already got the back door i think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage especially aimed at commercial targets this scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it too i ve heard rumors over the years that some factions within nsa were unhappy with des because it was too good not that they couldn t crack it but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they d want they re keeping the details secret so that others don t build their own implementations without the back door the cryptographic protocol though is another matter i see no valid reasons for keeping it secret and as i hope i ve shown above there are a lot of ways to do things that aren t quite as bad

accuracy of this article but if accurate i find it extremely disturbing especially in light of various abuses of the ssn number regarding privacy i understand it is now to be required in ca to renew a drivers license or to register a car and other proposals regarding smart national identity cards wiretap proposals and such one simply wonders what other gems are in the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government perhaps suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from acquiring the force of law would be useful the cost simply outweighs any possible benefits imo btw reading this makes me think of some ideas a prof denning has been promoting in an even more disturbing form that said with no further comment the article follows begin included article note this file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc ncsl nist gov in directory pub nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these

the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc not to pick on mr may in particular of course but isn t this kind of the domino theory when one little country falls its neighbor will surely follow and before you know it we re all mining salt in siberia for not turning in our captain crunch secret decoder rings i wish i could agree with you ask yourself this why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was known to be at least partially compromised key escrows in this instance why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated i e algorythm not publically released the answer seems obvious to me they wouldn t there is other hardware out there not compromised des as an example triple des as a better one my suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems if not we re in trouble given that the clinton administration is not entirely stupid although we d like to think so i cannot believe that they have failed to realize this they know their initiative will fail much as crippled des was never taken seriously the only way their moves can work is by coercion you know little about politics if you don t realize that this is just a first step in the next move it makes no sense otherwise the next move banning or severly crippling crypto not using the clipper system is easily justified why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government we ve provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail be fined whatever how can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the u s you simply can t and the administration knows it anyone who wanted to keep the govt out of their hair be it for drug dealing or whatever would just buy still available non clipper systems don t sell our crafty clinton types short they can t be that stupid either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective i q is about that of a potato why do you think at t jumped on so fast they know it s going to be big and not because it s better right on the face of it noone will buy the stuff that doesn t have to at t must know this too think man why the hell would they jump the gun my interpretation andrew tim may whose sig block may get him busted in the new regime isn t this just a little melodramatic i really wonder to wit the letter i just sent to clinton the white house office of the press secretary c o presidential comment line fax april sir and or madam i must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography i am shocked at the clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life it is apparent to me that those who drafted the clipper chip proposal which is incidentally gaining notoriety as the big brother proposal are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm especially one destined for standardization is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors the proper evaluation of an algorithm dep ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm the assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from experts without full disclosure is plain ignorance in addition the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology such as des when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy it seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow no matter how tamper proof the key escrows might be i cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws i can only assume then that the drafters of the clipper chip proposal knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector the only way this proposal makes any sense or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti lize the big brother chip unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing i expect the big brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the american people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like harmony right to encryption and voluntary it mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the clinton administration is i can t believe it s happening here more startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and

sci.crypt	re how does it really work was re text of white house announcement and q as on clipper chip encryption marc vanheyningen mvanheyn cs indiana edu writes the main thing i just don t get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques anybody know i don t know but i m as willing to speculate as anyone several people have suggested that the chips use public key cryptography another possibility is to use diffie hellman key exchange or some other algorithm which has a similar effect dh allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography something like des for the encryption how could the back door keys work in this system i can see a few possibilities one is that the dh like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one or possibly both communicants perhaps the random numbers used in the dh are seeded by the back door key or some such another possibility as was suggested here earlier is that the chips simply broadcast the session key encrypted with the chip s own internal secret key in this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast actually the chip s secret key doesn t need to be a public key in this usage but can be identical to the secret back door key this proposal seems most straightforward to me still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a dual key property that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it one key would be the session key from the dh exchange and the other would be the back door key for the chip it s worth noting that one of the proposals dorothy denning raised during her amazingly prescient on line discussion last november and december was a variation on diffie hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys this doesn t quite fit into what we know of how clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of clipper or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with clipper designers may have had diffie hellman on their minds hal finney

sci.crypt	re once tapped your code is no good any more in article apr clarinet com brad clarinet com brad templeton writes in article tcmayc m xv jex netcom com tcmay netcom com timothy c may writes getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver as i understand the proposal i could be wrong but i ve seen no mention of session keys being the escrowed entities true in theory in practice the technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key if the frequency path depends on they key as i understand it to it could be made effectively impossible to record i am not an expert in the cryptography science but some basic things seem evident to me things which this clinton clipper do not address the all pertain to opportunites for abuse and conclusions based on what i have seen the membership of this group except for two notable persons agree to if anything bad is possible by the government in theory it almost always ends up happening in fact so the key is to make abuse impossible question authority and remember power does corrupt i think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it will be expanded to include other data forms such as data transfer and stored data and as such should be treated as if it were expanded or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop using clipper as a precident there was a hint of that in the proposal remember that said please bear with me i am not very articulate so i take more words to say what others could say much more briefly thank you once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access the telco isn t supposed to give that without a warrant that s the rule today as i suggested this is now the hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer data files and such largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies i think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when not if it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones i think this is guaranteed to happen if this proposal gets by salami politics it has been and is used in several other areas it is certain to be used here government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to court order required has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee if the case warrants they can always sieze the material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges so it is not denying the justice system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty or refuses to divulge the means to access the info this is not protected under the fifth one can be forced to perform acts that would result in divulging incriminating evidence so blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing legitimate law enforcement it does make illegitimate law enforcement a bunch more difficult especially fishing expeditions without the target s knowlege don t give up the right to be safe from that that should be non negotiable and clinton and co know it which is probably why they quietly developed this thing figuring if they get it this far they can ram it on through how come those consulted could be roughly described as us insiders they cannot quietely impliment it though when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use hence the nice pr document to try and reassure everyone don t buy into it has government really earned that kind of trust past or future to be secure and free one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse impossible not unlikely or difficult but even so the evidence would not be admissible i think unless the judge so ordered i think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal cops can t record today s plain cellular calls and then ask a judge hey can we have permission to listen to those tapes can they so what one could use information gained by re use of the keys saved after the last case was finished or other means master key backdoor easily broken algorithm to find other evidence which given to a judge would authorize a tap which wouldn t have been possible otherwise this has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past for local cops this might be workable to keep them honest but the feds have a workaround somehow bet on it does anyone really believe for example that the government will use a scheme nsa cannot listen in on scanning for keywords either easily defeated in realtime or via a master key i sure don t this whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old fashioned police work to build a case in the past eavesdropping was rather easy with or without a court order i think the law enforcement community has become a bit spoiled and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old fashioned detective work i just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights that puts people first the question is put people first to where with the innards not being revealed how is one to be sure there doesn t exist a master key for use by nsa etc so they can do their keyword scan etc on conversations they routinely monitor without a specific court order remember the cellular phone limitiation is only temporary bet on it and so far i have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found what is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for next time after awhile they would have quite a collection kept especially for folks they deem disruptive and if they get only one key that would reduce the search space a lot unless it is an rsa scheme remember nixon years need for court orders really slowed them down didn t it and unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled fat chance i see one ending up being under say treasury the other under justice it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor s clinton clipper or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non government encryption enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm perhaps not an important concern but given past government behavior and the other problems worse of course if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc yes that is a major concern but i think that they think they can win just by having of the usa use this system they don t even have to care about the cautious that s left they don t catch the really smart crooks anyway john gotti who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans that s why he s in jail now hard to believe but true what will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption you can bet that if clipper is accepted that will be next on the agenda it is even hinted at in the proposal read it carefully expect the argumet well if you got nothing to hide fine then using that argument one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one s home granted an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds private stuff should remain private even from a govt fishing expedition and laws rules may change in the future as to safeguards when it comes to the fed government safeguards are pretty meaningless if they want to do get something don t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights or establish bad precidents please the price could be hell to pay later this scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more which people would fight a lot harder they like this enough that they are dropping the so called digital telephony proposal according to rumours however the meaning of that is complex since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems and that requires a bit of work people would fight laws forbidding more now but in say two years because we have this crisis situation which must be addressed by some drastic action just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide etc please don t buy into it if the clinton clipper is so very good why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it rather than a few isolated respected experts respected by whom for what perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating if i recall how would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the clipper chip if it is kept secret perhaps the clipper will use a crippled version with a master key provision or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts and who chooses the expertes the government no conflict of interest there and isn t it a requirement for any decent encryption scheme that it not have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known i was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have except for the key s i recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret another question since it is a safe bet this clipper thing would not be used for government security they are regarding it as not real secure but good enough for common folk i think i would like to see a full description not a pr non statement of just what good enough means i think when saying how strong it is good enough really means not very the excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable other countries do not have our bill of rights and constitution which the people not the governments of those other countries often regard with envy what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges and if we expect to retain those rights and protections we must not allow them to be gutted because we just gotta have this thing to fight crime we have allready have our bill of rights pretty much torn to shreds we should not permit more weakining for yet another noble cause instead we should be trying to repair the damage our crime problem may have a number of causes but too many rights and safeguards is not a signifigant one a broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having too many rights disregarding addressing the root causes for crime etc btw those who suggest that this is just an attack on clinton believe this i would be going ballistic reagardless who seriously proposed this thing it is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the constitution or bill of rights the last couple of decades have been a non stop series of end runs around the protections of the

sci.crypt	clipper chip technical details i received the following two notes from martin hellman with details on how clipper will work they are posted with his permission the implications of some details are fascinating date sat apr pdt from martin hellman hellman isl stanford edu to a long list of recipients subject clipper chip most of you have seen the announcement in friday s ny times etc about nist national institute of standards technology announcing the clipper chip crypto device several messges on the net have asked for more technical details and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news articles so here to help out is your friendly nsa link me i was somewhat surprised friday to get a call from the agency which supplied many of the missing details i was told the info was public so here it is the cc of this to dennis branstad at nist is mostly as a double check on my facts since i assume he is aware of all this please let me know if i have anything wrong the clipper chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in silicon each chip will have two secret bit keys one will be the same for all chips ie a system wide key and the other will be unit specific i don t know what nist and nsa will call them but i will call them the system key sk and unit key uk in this message the ic will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret aside it is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and in my opinion it may be as much for that as this stated purpose the unit key will be generated as the xor of two bit random numbers k and k uk k k which will be kept by the two escrow authorities who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the attorney general but it was stressed to me that they will not be nsa or law enforcement agencies that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased when a law enforcement agency gets a court order they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive k and k thereby allowing access to the unit key uk in addition to the system key each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired call this key plain old k when a message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under k then k will be encrypted under the unit key uk and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key sk producing e e m k e k uk serial number sk when a court order obtains k and k and thence k the law enforcement agency will use sk to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link aside it is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links with or without a court order since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow this gives the agency access to e m k e k uk serial number in the above message they then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the watch list for which they have a court order if so they will decrypt e k uk to obtain k and then decrypt e m k to obtain m i am still in the process of assessing this scheme so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme all i am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably but i will say that the need for just one court order worries me i would feel more comfortable though not necessarily comfortable if two separate court orders were needed one per escrow authority while no explanation is needed the following story adds some color in researching some ideas that silvio micali and i have been kicking around i spoke with gerald gunther the constitutional law expert here at stanford and he related the following story when edward levi became pres ford s attorney general right after watergate he was visited by an fbi agent asking for the wiretap authorizations when levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over blank signed forms every time levi did not comply and changed the system but the lesson is clear no single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps or worse yet divulging of personal keys sometimes he or she will be an edward levi and sometimes a john mitchell martin hellman date sun apr pdt from martin hellman hellman isl stanford edu to smb research att com subject re clipper chip it is fine to post my previous message to sci crypt if you also post this message with it in which i ask recipients to be sparse in their requesting further info from me or asking for comments on specific questions by this posting i apologize for any messages i am unable to respond to i already spend too much time answering too much e mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other responsibilities i note a probably correction sent to me by dorothy denning she met with the person from nsa that i talked with by phone so her understanding is likely to better than mine on this point where i said the transmitted info is e e m k e k uk serial number sk she says the message is not double encrypted the system key or family key as she was told it is called only encrypts the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted unit key this is not a major difference but i thought it should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to my attention it makes more sense since it cuts down on encryption computation overhead

sci.crypt	big brother clipper chip there are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the big brother clipper chip the drug dealers and terrorists aren t going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption in the new york times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them a mr deely an nsa official said there are a lot of medium sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group for every john gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are the press given to the big brother chip will only increase their numbers even if there is some benefit to law enforcement through the use of big brother it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved for example in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local law enforcement people i suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations it probably also helps keep the conviction rate high the fact that the torture tool is not used in this country even with a court order obtained by showing probable cause is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right i think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of big brother i vote for morality i am quite disturbed by what i interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this big brother chip is not put into wide spread use after a quick reading of the white house press release i came away with that impression to most of the american public the word hacker has rightly or wrongly come to mean high tech adolescent vandal it has struck me that most of the people posting to sci crypt regarding this issue are intelligent thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding big brother i hope that the use of big brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal i would hate to see this become some kind of high tech volstead act the high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an sst the times they are a changing and just as ibm is learning that they can t do business the same way they have done it for the past years maybe nsa should evaluate another approach eff who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of big brother may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved al gore may want to think this one through a little more and as for dorothy elizabeth robling denning en quoi cela vous concerne cheri

proposal is limited to scrambled telephony if it is only used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file as usual david sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read the proposal clearly states the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links it speaks about telecommunications in general read it again david maybe you ll understand it the next time nah probably not encryption then it is an improvement over the current mass produced standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to easy to break inverters that s exactly what the government wants all sheep minded people to think let s look at the current situation it allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody unless secure and i mean secure encryption is used what will happen when if ha optimists the new proposal gets accepted almost nobody except some will be able to eavesdrop everybody else but the ability of these some to eavesdrop will be guaranteed the proposal emphasizes on the former almost nobody which is clearly an improvement and forgets to mention the drawbacks of the latter guaranteed yes my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful you think that it will not happen good luck note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap it s not just continued ability it s guaranteed ability before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e mail and files let s focus on this yeah that s exactly what your government wants you to think let s take small steps one at a time concentrate on the current one don t think about the future trust us one question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it it s not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the intention they unlike you read what they write though i share many of the concerns expressed by some i find the proposal less threatening than many others since right now most americans have no secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can eavesdrop this would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones yes it will it will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now it will allow only to the government to eavesdrop if the scheme is secure of course which is yet to be proven but how do you know that the jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow the new proposal guarantees him the ability to eavesdrop then hell that will even motivate him to get that job if he indeed is that mentally pervert reading between the lines i infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys great the greatest cryptographer of all times david sternlight tm has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any details whatsoever and has concluded that it is highly secure i guess that comes from the background of working some years for the two major crypto evaluating companies right gee now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto experts to secretly analyse the new secret method for david sternlight has already done all the job for them this would meet the needs of u s businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including french and japanese security services and rich japanese companies it allows the nsa to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs trust us we re from the government and we re here to help you most legitimate u s corporations trust the nsa and would be delighted to have a high security system certified by them even at the price of depositing keys in escrow i see no difficulty in creating a reliable those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of future safety do not deserve either this or something like that i don t have the exact quote but the meaning is the same has been said by one of your great men maybe you should study their works more carefully if you have the brains to understand them of course from my point of view this is a fair starting point there are concerns that need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows but in the main question is to guarantee to availability of really secure cryptography to the masses gee if the proposal was saying we guarantee that every american will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s he would like and regard this proposal as just a default voluntary implementation there would have been much less opposition for some reason they didn t even try to promise you that i wonder why was orwell off only by years return we get access to high security crypto no in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled many have suggested that des and other systems may be breakable by the nsa and hence others similarly skilled and endowed while the above is just rumors and while even if it is true it is not done easily the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who has the two keys it might be also breakable by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick or who has only one of them nsa also told you that des is secure why don t you simply trust them huh there is at least a good possibility which should be checked that the proposed system is not so breakable it doesn t have to it is guaranteed to be easily breakable just get the keys it might be even easier but until there is some evidence this is just a wild speculation be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys the trapdoors are there in government s hands the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order legitimate and who decides what communications are legitimate oh i guess it s the government right the guys who already have the keys it s kinda if i have the keys from your car and i am asked to decide who has the right to use it legitimately in discussing this let s try to avoid the nastiness personal attacks and noise of some previous threads

sci.crypt	report on privacy protecting off line cash available i recently published a new privacy protecting off line electronic cash system as a technical report at cwi being a phd student at david chaum s cryptography group our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy protecting cash systems the report is called cs r ps z contains pages and can be retrieved from ftp cwi nl from the directory pub cwireports aa the postscript file is suitable for dpi laserprinters abstract from coverpage we present a new off line electronic cash system based on a problem called the representation problem of which little use has been made in literature thus far our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms using the representation problem as a basic concept some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems as a consequence our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously another important aspect of our system concerns its provability contrary to previously proposed systems its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent specifically if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash function the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the diffie hellman problem our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems in our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system including all the extensions can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers which has the important advantage that double spending can be prevented in the first place rather than detecting the identity of a double spender after the fact in particular it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success independent of computing power by a simple mechanism from within the system which is something that previous solutions lack entirely furthermore the basic cash system can be extended to checks multi show cash and divisibility while retaining its computational efficiency cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system i made a particular effort to keep the report as self contained as possible nevertheless if you have any questions please e mail to me and i will try to reply as good as i can any comments are also welcome stefan brands cwi kruislaan sj amsterdam the netherlands tel e mail brands cwi nl

sci.crypt	re more technical details hmm followup on my own posting well who cares first let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the clipper chip from what hellman and denning were able to tell us the chip itself is not confined to digital telephony but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner the chip supports cfb ofb ecb and whatever the fourth mode of operation for des is the algorithm consists of rounds of whatever and takes bit keys input data seems to be bit yes so if two people want secure communication whatever that means when clipper is involved they have first to agree on one secret key or is it one key per direction they can exchange this key via dh schemes or however somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the clipper chip which is now ready to work the clipper chip carries an unique serial number bit s and key bits these key bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial number with seed bits the seed bits seem not to be stored in the chip at beginning of communication and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin before sending the fist real bit output of the first encryption the clipper chip put s out packets i guess which represent the serial number and the session key this might look like x e k chipkeyk k serial number where x is a transformation of these packets involving a family key this family sp key is equal for all chips x might be a simple xor after that the digital phone call can be done as usual every packet being encrypted and decrypted by clipper denning describes how k and k shall be generated using a seed of bit s now leaving alone politics which does not concern me as much as you not being an american citicien tm there are some weak points in this scheme which might be exploited by several parties as far as i know about the generation of k k s and s look like the obvious backdoor they could be used to generate the chip keys by knowing the serial number and also the family key of the chip i really can t imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise as true random sources for the generation of the k k can be bought for not to much money then the escrows each of them will get bit of a bit key security could as little as existant be maximized by giving them bits each which have to be xored together to give the k k now let s simply assume the escrows are trustworthy and can t be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies and there will be no quarrel between escrows and l e a which would hinder the l e a in doing their duties and so on and so on once the keys are surrendered the corresponding chip is compromised forever not very clever imho how about sending in the encrypted session keys for each phone call that the police or whoever want s to listen to escrows could then simply decode this session key and send it back to police and would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired this would be a better technical solution but i guess politics will not work that way apparently as miss dennings stated the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the fbi great so local guys can not inter cept understand your traffic anymore does this mean that the fbi monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps how is law over there i have no idea who is allowed to tap and who not this certainly means that watched communi cations will be routed automatically from the service providing company to the fbi if the communicaiton is a watched one and this means as far as i understand it that the family key has to be known by each switching company and those providing cellular phone servies etcetc so the family key will not be very secret and thus serial numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares i like traffic analysis what do you guess what happens if you use the chip in ecb mode and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled so the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line hmmm shouldn t be so difficult to do that and now a last point for the other side after all i have read and heard about clipper not the programming language for dbase is it it seems to have many advantages which shold not be overseen now an afterthought to your rights please note that i have no idea what i am talking about from grady netcom com ef amendment congress

gillogly trewesday astron s r thanks for posting this and making it available this post will be long i will comment on most of it and am reluctantly leaving all of the original in place to provide context please note that an alt group has been set up for the clipper stuff note this file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc ncsl nist gov in directory pub nistnews and via the nist computer security bbs at the white house office of the press secretary for immediate release april statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary hum at t vlsi and mykotronx are industry wonder what happened to ibm this should be right up their street and a mandateed scheme is voluntary mr orwell would love this program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like rsa idea or even des the above while literaly true is a clasic straw man claim in the context of non real time circuits such as e mail and the like the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links i would modestly propose that a mandated use of isdn would do more for commun ications than this lot for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption normmaly des technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information it also can be used by terrorists drug dealers and other criminals note the use of the word business in the above the whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only business use is legitimate for debate if you want the nothings you drop in your wife s ear to remain secret and private that is not even on the agenda for debate note that there is no role for you to contain private info in this the only reference is to information already in the hands of others the unauthorized release bit is also drawing a long bow most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it and revealing or often selling the info these people are of course in this proposal the people who will have the keys the criminals also use lawers courts the cia white house officials and pens to go about their business when will they be outlawed as well yeah several of them would be a better idea than clipper them again the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed by government engineers the chip represents a nsa new approach to encryption technology yeah this bit is very true it can be used in new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption a demo of the above claim on an ordanary pots would be a good nights entertainment i suspect note also the many not all as the general tone implies this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals the case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses i have not heard yet of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black the other side abuse by law enforcers is well documented even by govt agencies and the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans a key escrow system will be established to ensure that the clipper chip is used to protect the privacy of law abiding americans lets run that line twice not very carefully what it says the stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of clipper compulsory note the word ensure as to protect or law abiding i will leave to you so to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions the answer in this press release is yes each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device when the device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the attorney general access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices in addition respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings where do you find many experts any ex kgb people looking for a contract and as a later posting asks what of the stu iiis they already have it will be very interesting to see if the military and us embasies start to use it after all it is secure isn t it the govt will answer that point by its own actions the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption s dual edge sword encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield criminals and terrorists we need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates the privacy of our citizens including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes again personal use seems to be a unaskable question the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data under proper court or other legal order when necessary to protect our citizens ah so warrents are not always needed it seems the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace and the need of u s companies to manufacture and export high technology products the itars seem to slightly impeed this the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information this infrastructure of high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files as easily as today s telephone system transmits voice note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret only the proper people will be able to express an opinion hence only the desired result will emerge since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law encryption and codes have been around for millenia they are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time the systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter at the moment i have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet the provisions of the president s directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute of standards and technology questions and answers about the clinton administration s telecommunications initiative q does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations a no clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans q suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device what would they have to do to decipher the message a they would have to obtain legal authorization normally a court order to do the wiretap in the first place they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers the key is split into two parts which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key escrow data banks a the two key escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities at this point the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks it is a little hard to critisise a non proposal q how strong is the security in the device how can i be sure how strong the security is a this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today note we drop back to phone mode again if this is a true answer it can be rephrased as it sucks big time anyone who can drive the crypt work bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system this link between the security of the key eschrow and the actual algorithm is a real winner given that i have secret bit numbers could someone please explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities just make sure you read the cvs real carfully ok q whose decision was it to propose this product a the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved in this decision this approach has been endorsed by the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials quick with out looking back what name is missing from that list q who was consulted the congress industry a we have on going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative the people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them q will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers a the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them the reverse engineering provisions of the mask work act could be relevent here q who provides the clipper chip a mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance california and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption devices a we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices you don t not unless you are one of the right people q if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices a this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review the key escrow they missed the word secret here he needs a grammar lesson too mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology which the administration is developing i would say less secure less conveniant more expensive pgp is free less available and more prone to being comprimised proofs to the contarary will be welcome note proof the administration is not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement we will prohibit it outright as some countries have effectively done nor is the u s saying that every american as a matter of right is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product they don t seem to be saying anything that makes much sense and this proposal does prohibit it except in a very limited way and this is the one explicit reference to personal rights it is a denial and yes i don t think that the mexicans brazilians and canucks are included in clinton et als magnanamous gesture there is a false tension created in the assessment that this issue is an either or proposition rather both concerns can be and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned balanced approach such as is proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques the false tension is false the balance is between two repugnant points the right to privacy is hand waved to non existance by putting it behind the false assessment it is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps you deem suitable to protect your privacy is non negotiable hence is defined in the govenment language to be non existant if you don t agree you must be a criminal as only criminals don t agree with out laws also note the non question if what is here was not possible q what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration s policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration a it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans privacy help businesses to compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism it indicates we know that bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty insert suitable retoric and will stamp out this disorderly unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra national sentiment q will the devices be exportable will other devices that use the government hardware a voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements case by case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices the same is true for other encryption devices one of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to u s companies operating at home and abroad with this in mind we expect export licenses will be granted on a case by case basis for u s companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad we plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products this one is a real giggle in australia or france they will have to reveal the keys and the algorithm don t think it s at the top of my list of things i must have so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill of crock any for any others using it they must be nuts good luck folks paul

sci.crypt	the clipper chip a technical summary the following document summarizes the clipper chip how it is used how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project i d like to add that i was not in any way involved i found out about it when the fbi briefed me on thursday evening april since then i have spent considerable time talking with the nsa and fbi to learn more about this and i attended the nist briefing at the department of commerce on april the document below is the result of that effort dorothy denning the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning april introduction on april the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement at the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encryption chip called the clipper chip together with a split key approach to escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key chip structure the clipper chip contains a classified bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses bit keys compared with for the des and has rounds of scrambling compared with for the des it supports all des modes of operation throughput is mbits a second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an bit family key that is common to all chips n a bit serial number u an bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at t telephone security device as it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate a session key k with the device at the other end in general any method of key exchange can be used the key k and message stream m i e digitized voice are then fed into the clipper chip to produce two values e m k the encrypted message stream and e e k u n f a law enforcement block the law enforcement block thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure computer information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mikotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent enters an bit value s into the laptop and agent enters an bit value s these values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers to generate the unit key for a serial number n the bit value n is first padded with a fixed bit block to produce a bit block n s and s are then used as keys to triple encrypt n producing a bit block r r e d e n s s s similarly n is padded with two other bit blocks to produce n and n and two additional bit blocks r and r are computed r e d e n s s s r e d e n s s s r r and r are then concatenated together giving bits the first bits are assigned to u and the second bits to u the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u and u u and u are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies as a sequence of values for u u and u are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u the second disk is similar but contains the u values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s and s and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with clipper they will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key f this gives them e k u n they will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number n to each of the key escrow agents and get back u and u u and u are xored together to produce the unit key u and e k u is decrypted to get the session key k finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the fbi acknowledgment and distribution notice all information is based on information provided by nsa nist and the fbi permission to distribute this document is granted

sci.crypt	another key registration body bites the dust imho one of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration body is the aclu i think this is poor choice the aclu is essentially a group of auditors they audit how people s civil liberties are administered traditionally auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things and with good reason when i was a systems programmer it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view but wouldn t tell us how to fix it i always figured they just liked to critcize without doing the work to help fix the problem then i took a stint as an auditor and i found out the real reason auditors don t like to recommend solutions because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later the auditee can say well you told us this way would be ok it compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor s job taking the case at hand suppose aclu becomes a key half registrar suppose that perhaps through some error on aclu s part a key half gets away that shouldn t and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties the aclu gets wind of this and wants to take it to court but they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff which is not an easy position to be in there are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors at one place where i worked when payroll checks were printed they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine this drum was kept by the auditors who also kept the check stock and was brought down to data processing when it was time to do the checks i believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks if they were done yesterday and someone wants to do them again today he better be able to produce yesterday s checks so that they can be destroyed determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process one much more prone to mistakes that could put the aclu in a protecting the client versus protecting the aclu conflict of interest as always my opinions are my own lynn grant grant dockmaster ncsc mil

sci.crypt	re clipper considered harmful in article optilink com brad optilink com brad yearwood writes finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications in the network for ex post facto scrutiny once some criminal act is discovered and the instruments involved have been identified it seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained i can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained imagine archiving all pay phone conversations so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer you can listen to all their past drug deals and archive calls to from suspected mafia members potential terrorists radicals etc imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the world trade center bombers made in the past year since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do why wouldn t it happen ken shirriff shirriff sprite berkeley edu
sci.crypt	a little political philosophy worth reading read this through once or twice then replace prince with government or president as appropriate and read it again from chapter xx of the prince by n macchiavelli as translated by daniel donno in order to keep their lands secure some princes have disarmed their subjects others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated some have nurtured animosities against themselves others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted some have erected fortresses others have destroyed them now although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed i shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow to begin with there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects indeed whenever he found them disarmed he proceeded to arm them for by arming your subjects you make their arms your own those among them who are suspicious become loyal while those who are already loyal remain so and from subjects they are transformed into partisans though you cannot arm them all nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages when you disarm your subjects however you offend them by showing that either from cowardliness or from lack of faith you distrust them and either conclusion will induce them to hate you moreover since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed you would have to resort to mercenaries whose limitations have already been discussed even if such troops were good however they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies and doubtful subjects therefore as i have said a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects and history is full of examples proving that this is so but when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it and these as time and occasion permit he must seek to render soft and weak he must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain and since the subject demands it i will not fail to remind any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him if the reason is not natural affection for him but rather dissatisfaction with the former government he will find it extremely difficult to keep them friendly for it will be impossible to please them if he will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn from ancient and modern affairs he will understand why it is much easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former government and hence were his enemies than to keep the favor of those who out of dissatisfaction with the former rule helped him to replace it

sci.med	re sinus vs migraine was re sinus endoscopy i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularly motrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but had forgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts here i generally don t take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because i ve found them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sources that force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is some pelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then much worse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back i ve tried synarel it reduced the pain while i took it mos but the pain returned immediately after i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only real solution to my problem although i don t expect to have any more children i don t like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i had the surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggested i get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children so basically all i m left with is toughing out the pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin that doesn t work and motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago so i m through with it in fact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i take it regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in both legs as i ll discuss in a moment generally though i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain it s actually quite effective at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantime i m frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy i ve had mris xrays ct scan and emgs i ve had of them and don t intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i have several bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i think it is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scan was that there are two herniations l l and l l but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible test called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine anyway the bottom line is that i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back pain is there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is there i need some analgesic anti inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so i d always resume since last november i have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physical therapy for the last months times a week after the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at a lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began going away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i don t have nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off traction about weeks ago getting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoid taking analgesic for headaches i really can t avoid them entirely because i have other pain sources that force me to use them oh i forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery but i m avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but at a reduced capacity i m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing when the pelvic pain is bad i can t concentrate much i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because the pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it can cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad i can t really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time home and in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lot of migraines an average of to a month which last days i ve taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so i reduced the dosage but i don t like the side effects if i take more than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i will eventually take the cafergot my neurologist wasn t very helpful when i told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becomes available i should try that i ve tried several other medications fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but they either didn t work or i couldn t tolerate them so what can i do my doctor s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot of pain i ve had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped once from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely the succinylcholine and i ve already had surgery several times anyway the point of what i m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines some people need to take them to tolerate other pain janice rathmann

sci.med	natural anti cancer aids remedies the biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so extremely high and increasing is that natural methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being systematically ignored and suppressed by the money grubbing and power mongering medical establishment some examples of very low cost natural anti cancer remedies are listed in the following article natural anti cancer remedies a rd opinion some of these remedies also work against aids disclaimer this list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable the compiler of this list is not a doctor of any kind but is exercising his first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the subjects of his choice most of these remedies can be found in any grocery store most of the rest of them can be found in any health food store what is important is how they are used and what else is excluded during their use the day fast st day eat as much fresh fruit as you want one kind at a time preferably grapes nd day eat all the vegetables you want at least half raw including garlic also whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings rd day drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want preferably start with to ounces of prune juice with pulp followed by a gallon of pure not from concentrate apple juice then grape juice stay close to your home bathroom th day eat all the un salted nuts no peanuts and dried fruit you want preferably raisins and almonds almonds contain laetrile th day one gallon of lemonade squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water preferably distilled and add to tablespoons of locally made honey no sugar drink one glass per hour everyone including healthy people should do this one day every week preceded by a large glass of prune juice with pulp th day same as th day th day same as th day all days eat only the foods listed above for each day along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements plus as much distilled water as you want the grape diet eat to ounces of fresh grapes every hours am to pm every day for six days eat nothing else during the six days but drink as much distilled water as you want apple cider vinegar mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar not apple cider flavored vinegar regular vinegar is harmful in a glass of water preferably distilled and drink all of it do this or times per day for weeks then stop for a week repeat if desired do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods this remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a fungus as well as against other kinds of fungus infections the sea salt soda bath please keep an open mind fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in immerse yourself in it for a minute and then completely dissolve in the bath water pound of sun evaporated sea salt regular salt won t work and pound of fresh baking soda soak in this bath for to minutes while exercising your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down chomping your teeth together etc among other things the sea salt soda bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of x rays etc as described in the book born to be magnetic vol by frances nixon precautions only the one person using each bath should prepare it and drain it for at least minutes after taking the bath stay away from and even out of sight of other people your greatly expanded aura energy field during that time could disrupt other people s fields two hours after the bath eat at least ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures the bath may kill friendly bacteria also better yet take a billion bacteria acidophilus capsule which is also an excellent daily remedy against the effects of a i d s because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune system because this external bath can kill in ternal bacteria it may also be a cure for lyme disease do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm within days of a full moon nor during major or minor periods as listed in the solunar tables published bimonthly in field stream magazine because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy fields present at those times do not take this bath more than four times per year miscellaneous natural anti cancer remedies for skin cancer apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the affected skin twice daily and take to tablespoons per day of stabilized aloe vera juice internally for about months d m s o dimethyl sulfoxide causes cancer cells to perform normal cell functions almonds un blanched un roasted contain laetrile to help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day to help cure cancer eat several ounces of almonds per day never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally it will kill you take it intravenously only cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell this enzyme is also present in the digestive system anti oxidants are free radical scavengers and include vitamin e selenium mcg per day is safe for most people chromium up to mcg per day vitamin a iu per day is safe for most people superoxide dismutase up to units per day vitamin c up to mg per day and bht butylated hydroxy toluene to capsules of bht every night at bedtime will also make one immune against herpes both types suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes prevent spreading herpes to other people but will not cure herpes bht might also do these things against a i d s which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia see the book life extension by durk pearson and sandy shaw hydrogen peroxide dilute twelve drops of hydrogen peroxide in a glass of pure water preferably distilled and drink it do this once or twice per day hours before or after eating or drinking anything else apply hydrogen peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day use hydrogen peroxide only if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti oxidants described above vitamin mineral supplements are more effective and much less expensive when combined together in mega doses into single tablets made from natural sources cancer cells can not live in a strong maxwell north magnetic field especially if it is pulsating on and off a strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac in my opinion all types of ionizing radiation treatments for cancer should be replaced with daily minute doses of pulsating maxwell north magnetic fields properly made and operated radionics psionics machines can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well as most other medical problems some radionics psionics machines can even take cross sectional x ray like photos of cancer tumors etc with out x rays interferon tablets taheebo tea lapacho homeopathy can cure cancer and many other medical problems even drug addiction mg per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure prostate trouble this list is not exhaustive the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un diagnosed cancers as well as prevent them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart diseases they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially the day fast and the grape diet send a strong message to one s subconscious mind programming it to cure the cancer in my opinion if a person finds out that s he has cancer then s he should promptly try at least the first remedies described above in sequence starting with the day fast before resorting to the un natural and expensive mutilations and agonies poison burn and mutilate of orthodox cancer treatment organi ed crime disclaimer this list was compiled from unorthodox

free demo outside us comments i have a copy of this and it works as advertised i would say it is better for rsi prevention than rsi management because it does not allow breaks at periods less than minutes also it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day worked ok on windows though it did occasionally crash with a uae

i have had a play with this and it works ok its user interface design is much better in though still a bit unusual expensive tool around and it does the job it is also the only tool with a redistributable demo so if you do get the demo post it on your local bulletin boards ftp servers and bitnet servers does not include general info on rsi and ergonomics but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises tool typewatch freeware version october available from email to richardd hoskyns co uk anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury typewatch shar platforms unix tested on sco sunos mach character and x window mode description this is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously typing it does not provide exercises but it does check that you really do take a break and tells you when you can start typing again typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today each time it warns you which is useful so you know how much you really type it also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out the warning message appears on your screen in character mode in a pop up window for x windows or as a zephyr message for those with athena stuff tim freeman tsf cs cmu edu has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for x zephyr and mach not formally supported but email richardd hoskyns co uk for sco sunos character mode or tsf cs cmu edu for mach x window mode zephyr if you have problems or want to give feedback tool various calendar batch queue programs available from various sources platforms various description any calendar reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc rsi management tool or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen using windows as an example create a calendar file and include this filename in your win ini s load line so you get it on every startup of windows suppose you want to have breaks every minutes starting from am press f special time to enter an appointment enter hit enter and type some text in saying what the break is for then press f to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment by using windows recorder you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a rec file put this file on your run line as above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments with rsi exercises the above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at am and warns you to take a break this will depend a lot on your operating system while these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can t get hold of a suitable rsi management tool if you are techie enough you might want to write a version of typewatch see above for your operating system using batch jobs or whatever fits best tool digital watches with count down timers available from various sources e g casio bp description many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically while these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you are writing reading driving or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing comments my own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which actually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the left arm improved getting a count down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day i have tried an old fashioned hour glass type egg timer but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period keyboard remapping tools these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one handedly or with a different two handed layout one handed typing tools may help but be very careful about how you use them if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing and may therefore make matters worse tool hsh public domain available from anonymous ftp

sci.med	re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition in article lsj gninnl c saltillo cs utexas edu turpin cs utexas edu russell turpin writes i wrote or to use a phrasing that i think is more accurate science is the investigation of phenomena that avoids methods and reasoning that are known to be erroneous from past foul ups in article c iu hbn bunyip cc uq oz au bd psych psy uq oz au writes i can agree with this if you are talking about the less fundamental aspects of scientific method in fact i don t see the alternative as i don t think that the fundamentals are capable of experimental investigation in saying this i am agreeing with the work of people like kuhn feyerabend and lakatos while methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of experimental investigation as that to which it is applied it can be critically appraised methodologies can be compared to each other sometimes by the conflicting results they produce this kind of critical appraisal and comparison together with the inappropriateness of existing methodologies for new fields of study is what drives the evolution of methodologies and how we think about them as usual you are missing the whole point russell because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes this is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes it would be a poor thing indeed what was the methodology of darwin what was the methodology of einstein what was for that matter the methodology of jenner and pasteur in an earlier article russell turpin writes none of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo science modern advocates of homeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine receive little respect because for the most part they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research lee lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty this does not imply that all their treatments are ineffective it does imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are incapable of discovering which treatments are effective and which are not first of all i think you are arguing against a straw man because i don t think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudo science homeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine should be accepted as science i in particular think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky what some of us do believe however is that some of these things including some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientific attention if in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not then science today would not exist for all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology by current standards was seriously flawed it is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to re examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies it is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation this truly marks one s attitude as doctrinaire cultist this attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitnet

experience pain at all then you absolutely need to go see a doctor as soon as you possibly can the difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn out ordeal go see a doctor now your garden variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems don t wait though go see a doctor the remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by new zealand s department of labour occupational safety and health service occupational overuse syndrome treatment and rehabilitation a practitioner s guide first a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldn t have your hands note you re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors rsi repetitive strain injury a general term for many kinds of injuries oos occupational overuse syndrome synonym for rsi ctd cumulative trauma disorder another synonym for rsi wruld work related upper limb disorders yet another synonym for rsi cts carpal tunnel syndrome see below hyperextension marked bending at a joint pronation turning the palm down wrist extension bending the wrist up supination turning the palm up wrist flexion bending the wrist down pinch grip the grip used for a pencil ulnar deviation bending the wrist towards the little finger power grip the grip used for a hammer radial deviation bending the wrist toward the thumb abduction moving away from the body overspanning opening the fingers out wide now then problems come in two main types local conditions and diffuse conditions local problems are what you d expect specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and or tingling with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they re not necessarily the problem why does occupational overuse syndrome occur here s the theory normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers when you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow by the time you re exerting of your full power you re completely restricting your blood flow without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates nasty by products like lactic acid which cause pain once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the load this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues another by product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves they need blood too anyway when you re typing too much you re never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things worse specific injuries you may have heard of note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acute injuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real tenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath s ability to lubricate the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you ve got your problem tendonitis an inflammation of a tendon repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more pain sub acute tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive activity carpal tunnel syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms include feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation cts is often confused for a diffuse condition adverse mechanical tension also known as neural tension this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere amt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy others for just about every part of your body there s a fancy name for a way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how oos conditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment the most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relax if you re under a load of stress this is doubly important tune out the world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work every three minutes take a three second break every three minutes take a three second break really do it every three minutes it s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax if you can t sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep and relaxation are really a big deal there are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can reduce inflamation and pain custom molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengthen your muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hot cold contrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say what s best for you posture here are some basic guidelines i so liked the way this was written in the new zealand book that i m lifting it almost verbatim from appendix dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down don t flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair don t slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every minutes get up and bend your spine backward set the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area if you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available now i diverge a little from the text a good chair makes a big difference if you don t like your chair go find a better one you really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a good store and play with all these chairs pick one that s right for you in the san francisco bay area i highly recommend just chairs the name says it all keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements there is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for some people wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture you shouldn t be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer your keyboard to be right there if you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about degrees of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist pads may or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax it s often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed a number of replacements are available on the market today check out the accompanying typing injury faq keyboards for much detail requests for more info

sci.med	water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee type disease outbreak here is a press release from the natural resources defense council new data show about major u s water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee type disease outbreak to national desk environment writer contact erik olson or sarah silver both of the natural resources defense council washington april internal epa data released today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about large water systems serving cities from boston to san francisco do not filter to remove disease carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee the epa list is attached these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration said erik olson a senior attorney with nrdc water contamination isn t just a problem in bangladesh it s also a problem in bozeman and boston as of june about large surface water systems on epa s list probably will be breaking the law the safe drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution olson continued some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law s deadline olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities a survey of u s surface water systems by water utility scientists found that percent of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism cryptosporidium and percent contained a similar parasite called giardia adding to the level of concern a general accounting office study released today by house health and environment subcommittee chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation s system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink we must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public olson noted the time has come for many of the nation s water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink nrdc is a national non

sci.med	re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable however it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries usually there is some trade off between these two desiderata the search for scope and the search for certainty if th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since they lacked the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz nonetheless what newton and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made in article apr kestrel edu king reasoning com dick king writes somebody writes i doubt if einstein used any formal methodology he also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not einstein played by the rules which demand that hypotheses only be put out there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science taken to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade unionism where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing i don t in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology nonetheless it is one of the results and although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results i think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment and using less than perfect empirical methodology will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is one of the most significant errors in science choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance for instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative one could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpin s assertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors i think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others and i think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lady uhunix bitnet

related to organ transplantation and donation mike transplant recipients international organization long island chapter p o box huntington ny newsletter april volume iv no next meeting the next meeting is wednesday april at pm at the knights of columbus emerald manor uniondale avenue in uniondale our guest speaker will be dr lewis teperman dr teperman trained in pittsburgh under dr starzl and is now the assistant director of the liver transplant program at new york university medical center dr teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions he is a long time friend of trio surgeon to many of our members and always a gracious and delightful guest it is sure to be a very informative interesting and engaging evening our hospitality committee bette and vito suglia and jim spence will be well prepared and at last the weather should be cooperative we hope to see a very large gathering to welcome dr teperman wednesday april k of c uniondale last meeting it has been noted here before that the long island chapter of trio has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather being able to forecast rain sleet and snow fully a month in advance no tv weatherman can match us this time we not only scored again but we were also able to disable the long island railroad making travel really difficult none the less many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation our scheduled speaker mrs elizabeth linnehan a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not able to attend she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications however ms jennifer friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice ms friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening annual meeting in addition to welcoming dr teperman the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our by laws the main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs and to elect members of the board of directors for the coming two year term the nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the board anne liver recipient and don treffeisen robert heart recipient and eulene smith vito kidney recipient and bette suglia kay grenzig liver recipient jan schichtel kidney recipient larry juliano kidney recipient david bekofsky director public education litp those remaining on the board for another year are robert carroll liver kidney pancreas recipient jerry kidney recipient and jeanne eichhorn ron kidney donor and marie healy peter smith bone marrow recipient patricia ann yankus kidney and pancreas recipient walter ruzak kidney recipient this may seem to be a big board but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the board therefore in addition to the slate being presented for voting nominations will also be accepted from the floor there is no set number of board members and there is plenty of work in addition brief treasurer s and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring up we will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with dr teperman future meetings remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year may

sci.med	re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition in article lsu q innia saltillo cs utexas edu turpin cs utexas edu russell turpin writes i agree with everything that lee lady wrote in her previous post in this thread gee maybe i ve misjudged you russell anyone who agrees with something i say can t be all bad seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes and i still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesn t use methods deemed scientific can possibly know what s true and what s not deleted material which i agree with back to lee lady these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science these posters are making the mistake that i have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe a carefully rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study are too narrow to apply to all investigation i think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things to reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support in this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i come to this dispute about what science is not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci psychology and occasionally in sci med about nlp neurolinguistic programming much of the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research for years now i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes courtesy of your local university library not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the nlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest and most especially to be aware of the questions nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation over and over again the response i get in sci pychology is if this hasn t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can t be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme there ve got to be controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fast phobia trauma cure simple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the world s most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesn t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than minutes nlpers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is useful in treating post traumatic stress syndrome it is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists a subject only needs to be taken through the technique once or in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident the process doesn t need to be repeated and the subject doesn t need to practice it over again at home now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with a fear of heights as i used to have take them up to a balcony on the th floor and observe their response spend minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long term follow up is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks my own cure incidentally was done with a slightly different nlp technique before i learned of the fast phobia trauma cure ten years later now i enjoy living on the th floor of my building and having a large balcony the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobia trauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying we don t have any way of knowing that it s effective these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove your theory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal it s described in a number of books and i ve posted articles in sci psychology describing it in as much detail as i m capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal to me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes

sci.med	re barbecued foods and health risk this reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange technique i d never seen before he took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil the tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges in the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of two teabags of earl grey tea and a few cloves on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket type steamer with two chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for or minutes later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprises and concerns me are no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from about or years ago i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the u s yet it is still being used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what about or years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whatever happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so wrt natural wood smoke i ve smoking a duck right now as it happens i ve noticed that a heavily smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low molecular weight stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correct i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grill non drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like this duck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on the floor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals and yet another reason i ve heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains nitrosamines which are carcinogenic i m pretty sure this claim actually has some standing don t know about the others an amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it was discovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevils this is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic the guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal broiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit one charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to duncans

motor drives two counter rotating thumbs that move in one inch orbits releasing tension in the neck back legs and arms pressure point massager a to order or receive a catalog call hours days or fax at note when i ordered the massager the item number was different and the price was not when i received it i glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a difference in price i called them about it and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although it looks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as a reason for return in fact since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory i received this one in days he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the old one very reasonable people i have long term neck shoulder and back pain if i were a building i would be described as structurally unsound i have stretches and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enough time lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p t the tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headache sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye when my physical therapist has massaged my neck and the sub occipital muscles in particular the knobby areas near the base of the skull the headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged i ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient p t appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary i have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit is about a x rectangle about high with handles on each side and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about in diameter and protrude about above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non removable they are located more toward one end rather than centered see figure below they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from either side for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it for the neck head the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting or standing applying pressure with the arms wrists since my wrists are also impaired i m typing this over an extended period of time and i don t have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for me for my back i sit in a high backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i don t pin it up first as far as i m concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely i ll use do it if there are multiple considerations hassles i m more likely to not bother with it not only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on my neck sub occipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too hard against it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for a few days i laid off it for about days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for me it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades although again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although i cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since i ve had it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after too i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this was very timely for me this is the st product i ve ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co worker the catalog states they have been in business since it contains quite a few health care products and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other ones i ve seen such as dr leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom i m only but have ended up on some geriatric type mailing lists no big surprise here i consider many of those products to be rip offs particularly targeted toward the elderly with dubious health benefits i apologize for the length of this but it s the kind of info i would like to know before ordering something thru the mail robin

sci.med	re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed a definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadly and that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly my definition is this science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work lee lady writes i don t think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namely thinking and informal exploration are not recognized as scientific work unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake they fall under my definition i hope no one would consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as unscientific in article c nasf mh news hawaii edu lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lee lady writes seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes here is where i think we are talking at cross purposes it is not clear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about consider for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about one can read this definition and still not know that of all animal species are invertebrates that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc in short knowing the definition of invertebrates does not tell one what they are mainly about the misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i agree on both counts as an example of the second it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls as to the first i do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past have proven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others it is perfectly alright to speculate i have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right but the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence was presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work it is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness when proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many researchers minds this is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research as gordon banks has pointed out no one wants to become this generation s rhine one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal i think this is absurd actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal i wonder why the results were not published in my field dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished

that s because these peer reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of msg in people they re looking at animal models you can t walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans note that i wouldn t have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its use in humans this is precisely not what you said among others see olney s excitotoxic food aditives relevance of animal studies to human safety neurobehav toxicol teratol vol i m sure peta would love to hear your arguments tests have been done on rhesus monkeys as well i have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra ventricular the glu and asp were administered orally some studies used iv and sc intra ventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies for obvious reasons you must not have read the peer reviewed works that i referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk it most certainly is for neurotoxicology you know studies of glutamate involve more than food science whose talking about food science what is this comment supposed to mean neurotoxicology and tratology brain research nature progress in brain research all fine food science journals pardon me but where are you getting this from have you read the journals have you done a thorough literature search so point us to the studies in humans please i m familiar with the literature and i ve never seen any which relate at all to olney s work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons then you would know that olney himself has casually referred to chinese restaurant syndrome in a few articles why don t you point us to some studies maybe then this exchange could be productive the point is exceeding the window of course they re amino acids note that people with pku cannot tolerate any phenylalanine well actually they have to tolerate some phenylalanine it s a essential amino acid they just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood they re unable to metabolise it olney s research compared infant human diets specifically the amount of freely available glu in mother s milk versus commercial baby foods vs typical lunch items from the standard american diet such as packaged soup mixes he found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed foods mother s milk was well below the effective dose goodness i m not saying that it s good to feed infants a lot of glutamate supplemented foods it s just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you like we re talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you re misrepresenting it as received wisdom who said anything about received wisdom there is no question that orally administered doses of msg are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence these areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism humans are vertebrates now what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary anh and me of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone how do you expect anyone to do the studies on this it s unethical to sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans the food industry knows this that s why the animal model is used in medicine and psych if you re talking about straight sensitivity it would be useful to define the term there are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology i suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivities you and late occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults me certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young but the additivity of glu and asp and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and their hidden presence in hvp necessitates extreme caution why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults the main point is blood levels attained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than sc between who over what i would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that msg has no effects whatsoever you mean asserting you re being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused because you re conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other olney s reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants but that s not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious reasons it says nothing about msg s contribtion to the phenomenon of the chinese restaurant syndrome it says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the lab olney s work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities terry epelbaum and martin have shown that orally administered msg causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic gh secretion and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to msg gh is responsible not only for control of growth during development but also converts glycogen into glucose could this be the cause of headaches i don t know dyer

sci.med	re hernia in article c qopx mq encore com sheffner encore com steve heffner writes a bit more than a year ago a hernia in my right groin was discovered it had produced a dull pain in that area the hernia was repaired using the least intrusive orthoscopic method and a plug and patch i suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic now the pain occurs more often my gp couldn t identify any specific problem the surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time my question to the net is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from something else by far the still best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned physical examination if you have an obvious hernia sac coming down into your scrotum or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra abdominal pressure sometimes is not that obvious the hernia is small and you can only detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal whether you have a recurrent hernia or this is related to the previous operation i can t tell you the person that examined you is in the best position to make that determination are there non invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia every now and then folks write about ct scans and ultrasounds for this but these are far too expensive and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger howard doyle doyle pitt edu

sci.med	re eye dominance in article apr porthos cc bellcore com jil donuts uucp jamie lubin writes in article pitt uucp geb cs pitt edu gordon banks writes in article c e g world std com rsilver world std com richard silver writes is there a right eye dominance eyedness as there is an overall right handedness in the population i mean do most people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the other if so what kinds of percentages can be attached to this there is eye dominance same as handedness and usually for the same side it has nothing to do with refractive error however i recall reading seeing that former baseball star chris chambliss hitting abilities were in part attributed to a combination of left handedness right eye dominance i was part of a study a few years ago at the university of arizona to see whether cross dominant individuals those with a particular handedness but who had dominance in the opposite eye were better hitters than those with same side dominance of hand and eye i was picked from my softball class because i was cross dominant right hand left eye which put me in a small minority and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people to control the study she used a pitching machine fast pitch since i was used to slow pitch i didn t come close actually i think i foul tipped a few to hitting the ball if there were a lot of people like me in her study i e those who can t hit fast pitch or are not used to hitting off a machine i would seriously question the results of that study i think there have been some studies of major league players across a fairly large cross section of players to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was better but i don t know the results the woman who ran the study i was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population but i m not sure whether i d believe her janice rathmann

sci.med	good grief was re candida albicans what is it in article rind enterprise bih harvard edu david rind writes in article davpa ida liu se david partain writes someone i know has recently been diagnosed as having candida albicans a disease about which i can find no information apparently it has something to do with the body s production of yeast while at the same time being highly allergic to yeast can anyone out there tell me any more about it candida albicans can cause severe life threatening infections usually in people who are otherwise quite ill this is not however the sort of illness that you are probably discussing systemic yeast syndrome where the body is allergic to yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine there is a book the yeast connection which talks about this illness there is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists there s a lot of evidence it just hasn t been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used for example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always gives before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as nizoral to his new patients if they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics or more times in the last two years he s kept a record of the results and for over patients found that over of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for his program in my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classic symptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which i never had before started in november within one week of full dosage of sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes i m also greatly improved in other areas as well of course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people in my case it was sinus since that s the center of my allergic response of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i was from over years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there s no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you ll find a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time in summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guarantee their safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as i am concerned jon noring charter member infj club if you re dying to know what infj means be brave e mail me i ll send info jon noring noring netcom com jkn international ip fred s gourmet chocolate carlton place phone chips world s best livermore ca v mail who are you read alt psychology personality that s where the action is

soc.religion.christian	does god love you i have come across what i consider to be an excellent tract it is a bit lengthy for a posting but i thought i d share it with all of you anyway feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says may god richly bless those who read it d o e s g o d l o v e y o u q what kind of question is that anyone who can read sees signs tracts books and bumper stickers that say god loves you isn t that true a it is true that god offers his love to the whole world as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the bible for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john however god s love is qualified the bible says the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness proverbs for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm q but i am not wicked i am a decent moral person surely the good i have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have done how can these verses apply to me a by god s standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by god as a desperate sinner on his way to hell the bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven on the contrary we are all sinners and we are all guilty before god as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god romans the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it jeremiah q if i am such a wicked person in god s sight what will god do to me a the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called hell for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust deuteronomy q oh come on now hell is not real is it surely things are not that bad a indeed hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior the bible makes many references to hell indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth matthew when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power thessalonians q that is terrible why would god create a hell a hell is terrible and it exists because god created man to be accountable to god for his actions god s perfect justice demands payment for sin for the wages of sin is death romans for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad corinthians but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matthew q does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell a indeed it does that is unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins that someone is god himself who came to earth as jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all isaiah but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed isaiah for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures corinthians for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him corinthians q are you saying that if i trust in christ as my substitute who was already punished for my sins then i will not have to worry about hell anymore a yes this is so if i have believed in christ as my savior then it is as if i have already stood before the judgment throne of god christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him john q but what does it mean to believe on him if i agree with all that the bible says about christ as savior then am i saved from going to hell a believing on christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the bible it means that we hang our whole lives on him it means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the bible it means that we turn away from our sins and serve christ as our lord no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon matthew repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord acts q are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except through jesus what about all the other religions will their followers also go to hell a yes indeed they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account able for our sins god demands that we pay for our sins other religions cannot provide a substitute to bear the sins of their followers christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness john q now i am desperate i do not want to go to hell what can i do a you must remember that god is the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god as you see your hopeless condition as a sinner cry out to god to save you and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner luke sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved acts q but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him a wonderfully god not only saves us through the lord jesus but he also gives us the faith to believe on him you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god ephesians god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith so if you really mean business with god about your salvation you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible which is the only word of god in this brochure all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs give heed to them with all your heart so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god romans q but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god a yes god wants us to come to him in total humility acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in him the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise psalm because we are sinners we love our sins therefore we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins and if we sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins as god strengthens us we know that our sins are sending us to hell unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities acts q doesn t the bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be baptized will these save me a if possible we should do these things but they will not save us no work of any kind can secure our salvation salvation is god s sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas ure salvation is not of works lest any man should boast ephesians q what else will happen at the end of the world a those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever more for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord thessalonians q what will happen to the earth at that time a god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever more but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness peter q does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come a yes the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to save and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come matthew q can we know how close to the end of the world we might be a yes god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come as a thief for the believers there is much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very very close all the time clues in the bible point to this for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape thessalonians surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amos q but that means judgment day is almost here a yes it does god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning and jonah began to enter into the city a day s journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown jonah q what did the people of nineveh do a from the king on down they humbled themselves before god repented of their sins and cried to god for mercy but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not jonah q did god hear their prayers a yes god saved a great many people of nineveh q can i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into judg ment a yes there is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him hebrews in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge

appear here as indented paragraphs i have read mr camping s book compared it with what the bible actual ly says find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the future holds that i have ever come across and agree with him that there is just too much data to ignore while none of us is guaranteed one more second of life and while we therefore should take these matters very seriously regardless of when christ will actually return it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal destiny until we feel that our death is imminent is even more

soc.religion.christian	quality of catholic liturgy i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass it s driving me crazy the most grace filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how to do it led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to god but the best masses i ve been to were participatory prayers lately i think the proportion of participation has fallen and the proportion of sitting there and watching or listening or generally being told what to do which is necessary because no one knows what s happening next is growing example last sunday palm sunday we went to the local church usually on palm sunday the congregation participates in reading the passion taking the role of the mob the theology behind this seems profound when we say crucify him we mean it we did it and if he came back today we d do it again it always gives me chills but last week we were invited to sit during the gospel passion and listen besides the orwellian invitation i was really saddened to have my and our little role taken away this seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people and toward the musicians readers and so on new things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what s happening the new things have to be explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we re just sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the mass is about to be done in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay experts but that may not be just i do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing that s just a fact of bureaucratic life even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the lord s presence so we ve been wondering are we the oddballs or is the quality of the mass going down i don t mean that facetiously we go to mass every thursday or friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of god s presence but as far as the obligatory sunday masses maybe i should just offer it up has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in catholic masses lately john murray

soc.religion.christian	questions from a newbie is life a pass fail course and does god grade on a curve i m new here and only vaguely religious but i want to know what some of you people think specifically are there an infinite number of heavens and a person goes to the one that he she deserves or is it simply heaven or nothing hell also are we graded by those around us or has there always been some unchanging method is the person s childhood taken into account i m sure these must sound like over simplifications to most of you but i figure that you re the experts quinn eschatology is an area on which christians do not agree i suspect that s because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries and their writings tend to be highly symbolic however both jesus teachings in the gospels and books such as the revelation to john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death on a number of occasions jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation e g lk and a number of similar passages where jesus says things like even xxx will be better off than you in the judgement also i cor talks about someone who gets into heaven but by the skin of his teeth as it were but these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell and not all christians would even go as far as that the only christian group i know of that believes in multiple heavens is the mormons and they are very far from mainstream christianity far enough that many of our readers would not call them christian their ideas in this area involve specific mormon revelations in addition to the bible and holy tradition of a more generic christian sort note that many christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with god the whole point of christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn t possibly pass if you like test analogies god grades on a very strict and unbending scale but he also cheats he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher before actually doing the grading because some people end up in heaven and others in hell it s easy to see why you d be inclined to think of it as grading while there are differences among branches of christianity on details i think we all agree that in one way or another god cheats i am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far god s cheating extends will he accept people who don t explicitly acknowledge christ but somehow still follow him in their hearts many christians believe that this is possible at least in principle but certainly not all do jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved but it s not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he s going to place the dividing line certainly he made it clear that we can t expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not clh

soc.religion.christian	re ancient books i sent in something on this before but i believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described this is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time hl the standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of friedrich blass hermeneutrik und kritik einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen vol of handbuch der klassischen altertums wissenshaft noerdlingen beck portions of this are described in nibley the prophetic book op mormon pp slc deseret book if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned nibley describes blass as a typical german scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader nibley s extract from blass s work is in the form of rules for forgers it makes interesting reading i confess that i have not read blass s work only nibley s extract thereof my german falls far short of what would be required and as far as i know there is no english translation available however i believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame we will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery actually there are types of purportedly ancient documents alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof for example the dead sea scrolls these can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper inks and objects found with them this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent for example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago perhaps even having been through several generations of copists this is more of a problem but can still be tested although the test is not likely to be simple we cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself it is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be they can only date the document and identify its culture of origin for example i ve heard of a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a king in what is now iraq if this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have the holograph they could check the language content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a palestinian jew of that time however even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually wrote it we would know what time and culture it came from but barring a known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison scholarship must stop there there is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was as i say i m no expert on blas s work i do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works specifically we might ask is the document internally consistent does it contradict itself if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it is a forgery the longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency for this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents is it consistent with the history and geography of the time again a short non specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter day forger would be able to escape detection here we look for the minor inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check the devil is in the details what about the literary style of the work figures of speech etc any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us are there any such odd phrases in this book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there are complications if the document has been translated or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it a few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies they cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don t necessarily prove forgery these tests can be quite effective given enough material to work with but they are not easy they require the skills of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the questions to ask are is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin if there are things which don t fit how significant are they are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge later changes by copists or are they really significant there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture the end result of any such testing is occasionally certain particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies however often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document or maybe parts of it is probably authentic or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions this is often unsettling to a generation raised on tv where all problems are solved in to minutes with time out for commercials it is however the real world and what scholarship has to offer

soc.religion.christian	weirdness of early christians i am a good catholic boy a convert no less attracted by the rational tradition aquinas et al and the emotional authenticity in comp with the faddishness of anglicanism to roman catholicism i never had much time for the pope or any other heirarchs but i did and do believe in the sacremental system i always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as john emery a few posts back who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same with miracles too and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the bible as god s sole revelation it was not very good logic to argue that the bible proved god no i was happy to accept the church as god s revelation it was the church after all that existed before the bible the church that choose under grace of course the canon of scripture protestant ludicrosity i thought was shown by protestants breathtaking acceptance of luther s right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked but recently i read peter brown s body and society it is very well researched and well written but is raises some very upsetting questions the early christians were weird even more so than today s carzy fundies they had odd views on sex odder views on the body totally ludicrous views about demons and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings now the question is this were the first christians just as weird but we ve got used to them or did the pristine fall of the church happen within one generation it certainly did nt have to wait until the triumph of the church under constantine if so wha does this say about god s promise to always support the church it s no use throwing the usual protestant pieties about the church not being an organization at me it s a community or it is nothing and it was the early communities that were weird the institional church was a model of sanity by comparison i would be interested in serious catholic and orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue i m not sure it is an issue for protestants with their soul alone with jesus approach but for we who see the ecclesia as a koinoia over time and space the weird early christians are a problem this is an exaggeration of the protestant view many protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the church the soul alone with god is certainly important for protestants but it s by no means the whole story i have read the sort of history you talk about as you point out protestants don t have quite the same problem you do because we believe that the church had a fall at some point however protestant mythology typically places the fall around the time of constantine or more likely regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion starting from constantine but getting worse as the pope accumulated power during the medieval period the consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us most protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils including such items as the trinity and incarnation indeed in the works of reformers such as luther and calvin you ll find church fathers such as augustine quoted all the time i think you ll find many protestants resistant to the idea that the early church as a whole was wierd there is an additional problem for protestants that i don t much want to talk about in this context since it s been looked at recently that s the question of whether one can really think of augustine and other fathers as being proto protestants their views on mary the authority of the pope etc are not entirely congenial to protestant thought one thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology there are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church what concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see we see every christian who courted martyrdom but i think there s good reason to believe that most ordinary christians were more prudent than that we see the heroic virgins but i think there s good reason to think that many christians were happily married i can t help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now i think there s also a certain level of revisionism active in history at the moment i don t mean that they re manufacturing things out of whole cloth but don t you think there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel clh

soc.religion.christian	re reason vs revelation in article apr athos rutgers edu trajan stephen mcintyre writes in article apr athos rutgers edu writes i can only reply with what it says in timothy i m not here to discount parts of the bible rather i m here only to discount the notion of revelation the author of timothy told what he thought was the truth based on his belief in god his faith in jesus as the resurrected son and his readings of the old testament but again what had been revealed to him was based on at best second hand information given by friends and authors who may not have given the whole truth or who may have exaggerated a bit first of all the original poster misquoted the reference is from tim the author was paul and his revelations were anything but at best second hand and is came about that as saul journeyed he was approaching damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him saul saul why are you persecuting me and he said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom you are persecuting acts nas paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus pretty cool eh he became closely involved with the early church the leaders of which were followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth now you may say the holy spirit revealed these things unto him and we could go into that argument but you d be hard pressed to convince me that the holy spirit exists i agree i don t believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exists please don t complain about this being circular i know it is but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible additionally what he has written is again second hand info if it were given by the spirit and still carries the chance it is not true the spirit is part of god how much closer to the source can you get the greek in timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by god literally means god breathed in other words god spoke the actual words into the scriptures many theologians and bible scholars dr james boice is one that i can remember off hand get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of inspired by god the only way you would be able to escape this notion of second hand info is to have had the entire bible written by god himself and to tell the truth i ve studied the bible extensively and have yet to hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence showing god as the first author of this collection of books that s what the verse taken from timothy was all about the continuity of a book written over a span of years by more than authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god and as for reason read what it says in corinthians about human wisdom basically it says that human wisdom is useless when compared with what god has written for our learning if you knew of jesus as well as you know the bible you d realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for the common man what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the bible certainly not josephus writings or the writings of the gnostics which were third century at the earliest and though some claim jesus was he was human with all of the human wisdom the apostle paul set out to criticize yet would you not embrace the idea that jesus was wise jesus was fully god as well that s why i d assert that he is wise i realise that you may not accept the authority of the bible this is unfortunate to say the least because there is no other way of learning about god and christ and god s purpose with the earth than reading the bible and searching out its truth for yourself for your information i was raised without any knowledge of god by the time some of the faithful came to show me the word and share with me its truth i was living happily and morally without acknowledging the existence of a supreme being i have though read the bible several times over in its entirety and have studied it thoroughly it contains truth in it and i consider jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to have lived in fact i darn near idolize the guy but there s no rational reason for me to except god s existence please rethink this last paragraph if there is no god which seems to be your current belief then jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that god exists but he claimed to be god himself regards to c s lewis how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus in conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out about your reading of the bible not only does the spirit inspire the writers but he guides the reader as well we cannot understand it in the least without the spirit s guidance for to us god revealed them through the spirit for the spirit searches all things even the depths of god cor nas peace

soc.religion.christian	re unity in article apr athos rutgers edu maarten van loon cwi nl maarten van loon writes hello fellow netters and fellow christians about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches to a bible study group alltough i do have a personal opinion on this issue i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations my background member of a orthodox reformed church let us say a little the only unity i ve found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples i came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything into practice from those messages since becoming a disciple i ve found that when i travel to another church in the same movement they are just as accepting there as any other we had a retreat back in january when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up this retreat was for college students and it was as though i had known even the people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciple the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky one of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self sacrifice that is only one area in which disciples stand out from christians also another part of unity is a common depth of conviction i ve also been a part of some christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of conviction about everything they believed that was why they could be unified they didn t care about the truth but delighted in getting along together the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two other churches denominations with the same characteristics both have the same confessions there are only some differences with respect to for example the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use our creeds in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that is the question creeds what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly better so here is a first question can the congregation of christ be separated by walls of different denominations or is this definitely an untolerable situation according to the scriptures according to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going to be there as per a previous note i mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means there are also differences of opinion and belief however scripture states in the following directives i have no praise for you for your meetings do more harm than good in the first place i hear that when you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some extent i believe it no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have god s approval corinthians how will god show his approval by fruitfulness see acts but before that there are these qualities devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything in common glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people all these are mentioned in acts god also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted look at stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit acts who was later stoned acts can one say that only one of these three churches is the true church of jesus christ one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement i have yet to find that but the closest one i ve found is the boston church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected it is also the only one i ve seen which is totally sold out to god a problem closely related to these question is can we cooperate with other christians from these two churches before there is a unity this question is especially important for those who think that only one church can be the true one as for cooperation that can always occur unity on the other hand may never occur as for those who think about only one church being the true one i remind them that mark states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they will not lose their reward as with the boston movement i ve heard numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples of course few people admit that they ve ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement i know i haven t maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you for your information we have a lot of organizations here which are founded by people of one specific church and whose members are all members of that church this has been considered as correct for years only a few years ago people started to discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process some organizations are opening their doors for people from other churches etc i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me a clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively this causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions i would not say at all that this is something correct for a church group to do for any reason in one of the churches i attended for example there was an internal clique of people who were on the different groups committees organizational heads of the congregation they rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he would ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down but is still there so i must warn against such division within there s enough division without thanks for your opinions in advance maarten joe fisher

soc.religion.christian	the empty tomb the empty tomb can we trust it by the late wilbur m smith d d when jesus was on earth he made an amazing prediction about himself and frequently repeated it let me quote it for you behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again matthew wholly different from the normal experience of men jesus who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving reproval knew he would die before he was years of age he knew the very city where he would die he knew that the religious leaders of his own race would condemn him to death he knew that one of his own would betray him he knew that before his actual death took place he would be mocked and scourged he knew exactly how he would die by crucifixion all this is in itself remarkable but more amazing than the minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted would follow shortly after he was buried that he would rise again he even designated the time on the third day but since it is on this central fact the death and resurrec tion of jesus christ that the whole truth or untruth of chris tianity turns let us examine it more closely the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed the body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used and a great stone was rolled against the entrance the jewish authorities fully aware that jesus had predicted he would rise again had the stone officially sealed and on saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body early sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body to their utter astonishment they found the stone rolled away the body gone they rushed back to tell the disciples shortly two of jesus friends peter and john utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the tomb empty just as the women had said even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone matthew how did this tomb become empty one of the most famous new testament scholars in america professor of new testament literature in a large theological seminary wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb became empty and wrote it in a letter not marked by bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the chimney at christmas time but he didn t realize that santa clause never did come down any chimney at christmas time because there never was a santa claus and there is a jesus he died he was buried in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body was gone those are facts of history no one can escape the responsi bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old another professor dr kirsopp lake of harvard university tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt that the women went to the wrong tomb the facts are these first so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days even if the women did miss the tomb when peter and john came did they too go to the wrong tomb third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb there is of course a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor s ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is com monly reported among the jews until this day matthew this is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb was empty they never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true they knew it was true another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty the soldiers were told to say that jesus disciples came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep how could they know what was going on while they were asleep obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesus first as professor heffern points out the leaders of judaism in jerusalem who had put the lord jesus to death had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his resurrection because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty if there had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected then proved second surely one of the disciples even most of them would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent it may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lie and most of these men did the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories it would have lost it power instead this truth swept the world closed pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to a despairing humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever but not only did jesus come alive again he did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to him instead he appeared to them literally visibly frequently he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning matthew later that day to mary magdalene alone john and to simon peter also alone luke in the afternoon he walked with two of his followers toward emmaus luke and that night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at jerusalem mark luke etc a week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at the same place john once he was seen by above brethren on a mountain in galilee i corinthians and finally to the apostles just before his ascension mark luke acts as with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness but these theories are unreasonable without supporting evidence none has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of amherst mark hopkins president of williams john witherspoon president of princeton these men and countless others have believed it but suppose christ did rise from the dead what of it what has it to do with my life what has it to do with your life just this it seals with certitude the teachings of christ jesus taught many great truths especially many about himself he claimed to have come down from god he said he was the way to god he said he was the son of god who alone knew god perfectly he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life and no one else had it he said that whatever we ask god in his name he would grant it to us thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day he revealed that in these amazing unparalleled predictions he spoke the truth do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe that his words are all true the point is does not the truth of the resurrection convince us that he is none other than the one he claimed to be the son of god and then of course the fact that christ rose from the dead testifies that he has broken the power of death and that he will some day raise us also up from the grave as he promised in other words if this person jesus christ the son of god in all this he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life for he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins his compan ionship and help a joy that no circumstances can ever take away and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day those who have tried it down through the ages and there have been many have given their testimony and we today who believe also know
soc.religion.christian	re old vs new testament rexlex fnal fnal gov writes we can jillustrate this by pointing to the way god administers his judgment in the ot sins were not forgiven but rather covered up in the age of the church not only are sins forgiven taken away but the power of sin is put to death my this distinction seems quite arbitrary blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven whose sin is covered ps and quoted by the apostle paul even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin rom the biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel equivalent concepts in both testaments the dispensational distinction is unwarranted during the millenium we read that sins are dealt with immediately under the present ie that christ is present on earth rulership of christ i m sure rex has scripture to back this up you re suggesting jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of his law for millions perhaps billions of people such activity for moses the lawgiver was considered unwise cf ex ff it makes for interesting speculation though i ll leave comments on the so called bema seat vs throne judgments to someone else this also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala dispensationalism tom albrecht

soc.religion.christian	re quality of catholic liturgy in article apr athos rutgers edu jemurray magnus acs ohio state edu john e murray writes example last sunday palm sunday we went to the local church usually on palm sunday the congregation participates in reading the passion taking the role of the mob the theology behind this seems profound when we say crucify him we mean it we did it and if he came back today we d do it again it always gives me chills but last week we were invited to sit during the gospel passion and listen besides the orwellian invitation on palm sunday at our parish we were invited to take the role of jesus in the passion i declined to participate last year at the liturgy meeting i pointed out how we crucify christ by our sins so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd but to no avail musicians readers and so on new things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what s happening the new things have to be explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we re just sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the mass is about to be done in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay experts but that may not be just i do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing that s just a fact of bureaucratic life even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the lord s presence as a member of a liturgy committee i can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating who want to try out all kinds of innovations the priests don t seem even to want to make any decisions of their own in many cases i guess it s easier to try something new than it is to refuse to allow it at our parish on holy thursday instead of the priests washing feet who wants to get around people s feet according to one of our priests the congregation was invited to come up and help wash one another s hands the symbolism of this action distressed me and again i refused to participate i thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action i e body of christ amen for receiving communion that they could be i am not responsible for the blood of this man also for part of the eucharistic prayer blessed are you god of all creation was substituted some text read by a lay couple the priest certainly should not have given this part of the mass over to others and i was so disturbed that i declined to receive communion that night we aren t required to anyway i instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish so we ve been wondering are we the oddballs or is the quality of the mass going down i don t mean that facetiously we go to mass every thursday or friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of god s presence but as far as the obligatory sunday masses maybe i should just offer it up has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in catholic masses lately the quality of the mass has not changed again if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the church it would still be liturgically beautiful the problem comes about from people trying to be creative who are not i think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by father peter stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of thomas day s why catholics can t sing they don t want to because of all this nonsense by the way for any non catholics reading this the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the catholic church but by those who are disobedient to the church in changing it on their own authority steve creps indiana university creps lateran ucs indiana edu

make every attempt to make fun of no one except myself gsu uxa ecn bgu edu eric molas writes firstly i am an atheist i am not posting here as an immature flame start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience the human being is an animal who has due to his her advanced mental facilities developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable hmmm there are other animals on this planet with advanced mental facilities which have not developed religion as a satisfactory explaination for the unexplained why is this so further it appears that only humans have a need to explain the unexplained why is this so the other animals on this planet including those with advanced mental facilities seem perfectly content in their ignorance i d like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me from your unsupported statement they are humans are animal only religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need not be researched religion was made up by humans to address a perceived need the biological aspect of humans is deified that is all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical structure with biology at the apex needless to say i disagree with your strong opinion and the underlying presuppositions christianity is an infectious cult the reasons it flourishes are because it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind oh wow all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness for all of you found jeezus how many of you were on the brink i disagree that christianity is an infectious cult it has certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system in spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is infectious in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provides a workable system for its adherents and i would argue that this is the case i disagree that christianity is a safety blanket which supplants hope and purpose rather it points an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there is nothing hidden about a christian s source for hope and purpose of what usefulness to you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose is the apparent loss of control over one s own life the problem or is it something else finally one does not appropriate eternal happiness by following christian moral standards indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people from their imperfections moral standards are merely guides to the christian the real power to moral living is given to the christian in the person of god s spirit heaven is one of two final states that christian doctrine postulates however christians are generally not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this promised future reward rather they are motivated by the perceived benefits to them in the here and now but i digress the other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature a best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this priority spread the word many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a priority and rightly so for it was jesus himself who gave this as a priority for his followers however it is not the penultimate priority as evangelism is normally understood i e preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism is generally best done through respecting the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits of a christian lifestyle this demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non christian to seek out the christian to ask why needless to say such a demonstration is not easily accom plished it takes a radical committment to the person of jesus it does not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian is required and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of friendship exist it is ineffective with strangers who cannot evaluate the demonstration over time and it is easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of being a friend is to gain a conversion as a long time christian nearly years i view with some skep ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate a hurry up attitude pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all because the pressured convert realizes s he was coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings conviction of wrong doing to people i am content to do my part witness and let the spirit do the rest we are just animals we need sleep food and we reproduce and we die we are far more than animals we sleep eat reproduce and die just as other animals do true but we are also capable of more than this if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself is so limited i can only hope and pray that you will someday find a more expansive view for reflection what animals have the wide variety of performing arts that humans do how is it that humans can learn the language of other humans or animals but that other animals cannot do so how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social structures whereas other animals have only one structure religion especially christianity is nothing more than a drug blatant assertion christianity is not physically addictive christianity is not psychologically addictive christianity is not a thing which one snorts ingests shoots up it is a relationship with a living being you might as validly characterize any close knit relationship with this appelation some people use drugs as an escape from reality christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high there are jesus freaks who let the emotional aspects of worship and christian living gain and retain the upper hand even so this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these things flow it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars of which christianity has had no small part guilty by association that christianity which forces itself upon another is not christianity at all when christians see a non believer they say that person is blind to the truth but they cannot realize that it is they who live with this mask of fakeness each day jesus was just prophet who happened to have a large influence because at that time the romans were circa ad dispersing the jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened years ago how did you come by it i cannot accept your conclusion that jesus influence was a sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in ad he was years gone by this time it strains the bounds of credulity to assert that nothing about jesus life was noteworthy until the sack i must go

soc.religion.christian	proof of resurection i have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of christ s resurrection first the scriptural quotations this sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified if not then your beleif is in vain so you might as well beleive most of these quotations are of people who do beleive people who would try to justify their own positions second the logical proof quoted text from xx yfn ysu edu family magazine sysops subject witness proof of christ s resurrection date apr gmt much deleted in nearly centuries no body has ever been produced to refute jesus assertion that he would indeed rise from the dead the probability of being able to perpetrate such a hoax successfully upon the entire world for nearly centuries is astronomically negative end quoted text the period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered in fact the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes finally there is no proof of the resurrection of christ except in our spirits communion with his and the father s it is a matter of faith belief without logical proof incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for rational western man myself included i hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a rejection of the resurrection s occurance i beleive but i wanted to point out the weakness of logical proofs

apr athos rutgers edu caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin writes are all truths also absolutes is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes the answer to both questions is yes perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then to me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc true in every instance possible do you agree with this definition i think you do similarly all truth is absolute indeed a non absolute truth is a contradiction in terms when is something absolute when it is always true obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in terms i agree with carol here determining absolutes is practically speaking a waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative for example i recently was asking some children the question what temperature does water boil at i got the answer degrees consistently i asked if they knew what scale and was told it s just degrees any scale that s what all thermometers say well that s sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong it is not an absolute truth similarly scripture is full of truth which we should nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point then religion easily becomes an intellectual head trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of head covering in church deleted this was a good example there may be an absolute truth behind the writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth which was having a lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me no and i see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally i ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally the bible was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world such a statement is terribly self contradictory let me put it to you this way if there are no absolutes shouldn t we conclude that the statement there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously we have a contradiction here i don t claim that there are no absolutes i think there are very few though and determining absolutes is difficult i agree very few and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference since i know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me there is hardly consensus even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation so people sometimes disagree about what is true this does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe i can t prove the existence of absolutes i can only rely upon my experience i also trust god s revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite therefore we can t comprehend the absolutes so i don t need them i can never know the essence of god only the energies by and through which god is manifested to god s creation so the reality can be that there are absolutes but it is of no practical importance it s like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be swell who cares it doesn t affect me in any practical useful way i might as well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they live on mars maybe god did so what is that going to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god whether or not i go to this or that cafeteria for lunch no this attitude leads many non christians to believe that all christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning christianity is true wonderful and sensible it appeals to reason since reason is an inner reflection of the logos of god explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world note i m not claiming there is no place for authority that d be silly there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally agressive good parents like god are authoritative many christians are simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few adults respond to this treatment larry overacker llo shell com lawrence overacker

soc.religion.christian	re sabbath admissions of someone sent me this faq by e mail and i post my response here i m not enforcing the inclusion limits on this faq because most of our readers probably haven t seen it clh christ warns that anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven matt this faq is so full of error that i must respond to it i hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology brothers and sisters being new to the faith and examining the decalogue closely i ve noticed the fourth commandment is pretty specific about keeping the sabbath day it states the th day saturday is the sabbath while most christian religions keep or atleast go to church on sunday what s up this is a frequently asked question every time it arises it causes months of debate so let me see if i can answer you directly basically it s because the law was given to moses as part of a specific covenanent with the jews most of us aren t jews so we aren t part of that covenant there was an argument early in christian history about whether the mosaic laws should apply to gentiles who became christians you can see the account of this debate in acts the main question there was circumcision but keeping the sabbath would be part of it as well the apostles concluded that we need not become jews in order to become christians and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai rom notes that where no law is there is no transgression not only did sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath was kept before it was revealed on sinai ex the problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise which undergirded it god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people but in their ignorance after years of slavery they promised what ever he says to do we will do that is why the new covenant is based on better promises heb rather than do away with the law god promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts heb including the sabbath in the acts is selective inclusion the sabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision if any attempt had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in acts do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which was added because of transgression of the moral law gal israel stands for god s people of all time that is why god grafted the gentiles in roma says that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of god and the promises belong to israelites in explanation paul makes it clear that being born into israel is not enough for they are not all israel which are of israel v then in gal he says if ye be christ s then are ye abraham s seed and heirs according to the promise all christians are abraham s seed jews israelites not physically for that is not the criterion but spiritually we are joint heirs with jesus based on the promise god made to all his people the israelites while christians agree that the ot laws do not all apply to us because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the jews we also expect to see some similarity between the things god expected from the jews and the things he expects from us after all it s the same god however there are several ways of dealing with this these days the most common approach is to separate the ot commandments into moral and ceremonial ceremonial commandments apply only to the jews they are part of the specific mosaic covenant these are thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision moral laws apply to everyone most of the commands are part of the moral law except for the commandment about the sabbath i believe most people who take this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on the sabbath is part of the ceremonial law but a general obligation to worship regularly is part of the general moral law thus christians are free to choose the specific time we worship people would probably agree but they are wrong how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws you are not free to choose your time of worship even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship would you rather give up a day which god blessed sanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation see sabbath admissions in soc religion christian bible study a more radical approach which is generally connected with john calvin and the reformed tradition says that the law as a whole is no longer binding instead we are entirely under grace and our behavior should be guided solely by love portions of the ot law are still useful as guidance but they are not properly speaking legally binding on us in practice most people who take this position do not believe it is safe to leave christians without moral guidannce while we may no longer be under law as sinners it s not safe for us to go into situations with no principles to guide us we re too good at self justification for that to be safe thus christians do have moral guidance from things like jesus teachings paul s advice etc these may not be precisely a law but they serve much the same function as and have largely the same content as the moral law in the previous analysis while calvin would deny that we have a fixed legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that given human weakness the discipline of regular worship is important i do not care what calvin or any theologian says my guide is what god says if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the sabbath commandment which is the only one god thought was important enough to say remember if you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god if a cop pulls me over for speeding then in court i ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace do i walk out of the court saying i can now go on speeding for i am now under grace being under grace i now drive within the speed limit paul adds to it in rom di we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good rom in both analyses the specific day is not an issue as a matter of tradition we worship on sunday as a memorial of christ s resurrection there s some debate about what acts shows about early christian worship the most common analysis is that is shows jewish christians continuing to go to jewish services on the sabbath but that specifically christian service were not necessarily held then act shows worship on the first day sunday and i cor also implies gatherings on that day there are a few groups that continue to believe christians have to worship on the sabbath saturday the best known are the seventh day adventists and jehovah s witnesses they argue that act is not a regular worship service but a special meeting to see paul off and that i cor doesn t explicitly say it s a regular worship service do you prefer implication to fact a careful study of the acts shows that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to assos in icor there is no way you can equate lay by him in store with go to a worship service it s clear that this issue was a contested one in paul s time see rom paul s advice is that we should be very careful about judging each other on issues like this one person sees a specific day as mandated by god while another does not he who observes that specific day does it in honor of the lord he who believes his worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the lord those who believe that the sabbath is still mandated argue that paul is not referring to sabbath worship here note however col which says something similar but briefer it explicitly mentions sabbath wrong these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the sabbath day of the moral law there are some differences among christians about use of the word sabbath originally the term referred to the th day the jewish day of worship many christians now use it to refer to sunday the day of christian worship they do this largely so that they can apply the th or whatever there are a couple of different numbering schemes commandment to it reformed tradition does not do this it distinguishes between the sabbath which is the observance mandated for jews and the lord s day which is the free christian worship the only reference i can find to this in the nt is rev there are also differences about laws regarding this day many christians support blue laws both in secular law and church law setting aside that day and causing people to spend it in worship the more radical anti legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the jewish sabbath which is not appropriate to the free christian worship of the lord s day why would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different arguments which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a god who loved you enough to die for you jesus died because the law could not be changed why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable that is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws it will always be a sin to make false gods to violate god s name to break the sabbath to steal to kill etc except it you disagree but then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of god darius it s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq i think paul s comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord however i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship we get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question act describes christians as participating both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion services in homes obviously the temple worship is on the sabbath acts is an example of christians participating in them unfortunately it doesn t tell us what day christians met in their houses acts despite darius confusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday i see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start when the biblical text is clear about what was meant the wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting it doesn t say they gathered to see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread paul talked about his upcoming travel but that s just not explicit enough to be really convincing similarly with cor it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul s collection now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes i can t disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was clh

soc.religion.christian	etymology of easter for src in most languages the feast of the resurrection of our lord is known as the pasch or pasque or some variation thereof a word which comes from the hebrew pesach meaning passover in english german and a few related languages however it is known as easter or some variation thereof and questions have been asked about the origin of this term one explanation is that given by the venerable bede in his de ratione temporum where he derives the word from the name of an anglo saxon goddess of spring called eastre bede is a great scholar and it is natural to take his word for it but he lived and augustine began preaching in kent in the use of the word easter to describe the feast would have been well established before the birth of bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with it seems likely that his derivation is just a guess based on his awareness that there had been an anglo saxon goddess of spring bearing that name and the resemblance of the words thus if the said resemblance surely it is not surprising that a personification of spring should have a name similar to the word for dawn is not in istelf convincing the testimony or rather the conjecture by bede does not make it more so assuming that bede was right that would not justify saying that the christian celebration which after all had been going on for some centuries before the name easter was applied to it has pagan roots it would simply mean that the anglo saxons upon becoming christians and beginning to celebrate the resurrection by a festival every spring called it by the name that to them meant simply spring festival however bede s is not the only theory that has been proposed j knoblech in die sprach zeitschrift fuer sprachwissenschaft vienna offers the following derivation among latin speaking christians the week beginning with the feast of the resurrection was known as hebdomada alba white week since the newly baptized christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week sometimes the week was referred to simply as albae translaters rendering this into german mistook it for the plural of alba meaning dawn they accordingly rendered it as eostarum which is old high german for dawn this gave rise to the form easter in english yours james kiefer no i m not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety of celebrating easter however this seems like it contains enough interesting information that people might like to see it clh

soc.religion.christian	iterations of the bible hi i m not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame thanx in advance i want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible there is this version of the bible i have read about and on the front page it says contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies thanx in advance shaz i m not sure quite what you mean by many different versions the primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation it s pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning there are a few differences in the underlying text that s because before printing manuscripts were copied by hand slight differences resulted there are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original but there are some uncertainties fortunately they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording there are something like or places where whole sentences are involved but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts i don t think there s much uncertainly about those cases as far as i know no christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error but i also don t think there s enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect whether the bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here many christians deny it some accept it though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don t affect the faith but this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions the supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions i m surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though what version are you talking about i ve been referring to major scholarly translations these are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere there have certainly been editions that are to be kind less widely accepted this includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other the copyright on the bible has long since expired so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want however the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds with lots of crosschecks i could imagine one of the lesser known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies but if so it s not any edition that s widely used the widely used ones leave the text as is weeeeelllllll almost as is it s been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies because translation is not an exact science there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best i m afraid clh
soc.religion.christian	re help in article apr geneva rutgers edu lmvec westminster ac uk william hargreaves writes i m a commited christian that is battling with a problem i know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying you fools do you still think that just believing is enough actually i don t think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say first what is faith if you study the meaning of the greek and hebrew words so translated i think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a lot more than mere belief faith means both trust and action if you do not put your belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith i think this is what james means when he says that faith without works is dead and i will show you my faith by my works remember james was writing to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad this probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much later and wouldn t understand the meaning of the original greek indeed i suspect james was writing to us today among others he intended to reach paul on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the greek another key to why there is no conflict is to look at paul s statements in their context i think you will find that when paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the law meaning the law of moses this was the great burden of paul s life as the apostle to the gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people then the judizers would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the law of moses cf acts chapter in this context paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the law saying that we are saved by the blood of jesus and our faith in him i believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by faithfulness i think faithfulness today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves and not by god according to romans that person is still saved by there faith i think you misunderstand romans what paul is really saying is that god prefers a faithful gentile who does not keep kosher to a kosher jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the lord and having charity toward his fellows but then there is the bit which says that god preferes someone who is cold to him i e doesn t know him condemned so a lukewarm christian someone who knows and believes in god but doesn t make any attempt to live by the bible in the sense of faith described above you cannot have real faith and be lukewarm if you know god but are lukewarm unfaithful you are worse off than the person who never heard of him remember jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price mat and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field mat indicates that the price of the kingdom of god is all we have i agree with you in general including the fact that pistis has some of the force of faithful however if you take that too far you can end up with something that paul definitely would not have intended being faithful means following god in all things to say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins i assume that s not what you meant i have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this however i think paul is describing what i d call a basic orientation including aspects such as trust and commitment jesus speaks of it as rebirth which implies a basic change we may still do things that are sinful and may fail to show the new life in christ in many situations where we should but in any christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that jesus calls being born again clh

soc.religion.christian	re question jesus alone oneness regarding jesus only believers our moderator writes there may be some misunderstanding over terms here i agree quite likely actually i believe jesus only originally was in the context of baptism these are folks who believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only jesus rather than father son and holy spirit this may have doctrinal implications but as far as i know it does not mean that these folks deny the existence or divinity of the father i m not the right one to describe this theology and in fact i think there may be several including what would classically be called monophysite or arian two rather different views as well as some who have beliefs that are probably consistent with trinitarian standards but who won t use trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply because it is not biblical clh not biblical what then can they make of the end of matthew and jesus came and said to them all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything that i have commanded to you and remember i am with you always to the end of the age other ancient authorities add amen nrsv the notes give no sense that this is emended do other texts contradict this regarding baptism or is a misunderstanding of the trinity the most likely explanation after all but maybe i simply misunderstand their views is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good bible and an unabridged dictionary christianity really is an education in itself david r tucker kg s drt athena mit edu arrgggghhhh when i talked about people who rejected trinitarian language as unbiblical i was speaking of trinitarian theology things like one essense and three persons obviously the three fold baptismal formula is biblical as you point out i normally use the term three fold in referring to mat while it is certainly consistent with belief in the trinity the trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the th and th cent s it s unlikely that mat had in mind the fully developed trinitarian doctrine indeed the three fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the trinity the disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as acts which command baptism in the name of jesus there are a couple of other passages in acts as well this leaves us with sort of a problem we re commanded in mat to baptize in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit and in acts to baptize in the name of jesus jesus only groups baptize in the name of jesus they consider this consistent with mat because they say that jesus is the name of the father the son and the holy spirit i m not the right one to ask to explain what this means i will simply say that it does not appear to be normal trinitarian theology it is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase in the name of those who use the three fold formula don t seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of jesus i suspect that the most common explanation is to say that in the name of need not be a verbal formula to say that you baptize in the name of jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under jesus authority in the st cent context it contrasts christian baptism with the baptism of john or other jewish baptism of course there s a certain parallelism between these passages that suggests that we could just as well say that mat doesn t require the specific three fold formula to be used in baptism but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the father son and holy spirit one might well suspect that in the early church more than one baptismal formula was used so long as we consider following jesus to be the same as following the father son and holy spirit no great damage would be done by such a difference this does not mean that i think we should go back to using both formulae baptism is one of the few things that almost all christian groups now recognize mutually so i do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the gospel this is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use in the name of jesus now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine but as i ve said before i m not the one to explain what their doctrine is clh

soc.religion.christian	re when are two people married in god s eyes to recapitulate a bit the essence of marriage is two people s commitment to each other if two people claim to be married in their hearts but are not willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state that s prima facie evidence that the commitment isn t really there there are obvious situations in which christian marriage is possible without a civil or church wedding if you re stranded on a desert island or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason e g laws against interracial marriage the legal concept of common law marriage is meant to ensure that the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the usual ceremony and record keeping pastorally i m concerned that people should not use being married in god s eyes as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding one has a duty to have one s marriage properly recorded and witnessed but there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony without making a genuine commitment and therefore are not married in god s eyes right michael a covington associate research scientist artificial intelligence programs mcovingt ai uga edu the university of georgia phone athens georgia u s a amateur radio n tmi i think the last statement is dangerous i believe as long as someone has formally undertaken the responsibility of marriage they have a moral obligation even if their intention was not right other people are involved in the marriage covenant if they believed in good faith that a marriage occurred then i think there are obligations created to them of course there are situations where intent can cause a marriage not to exist the classic example is when it s done as part of a play but these are exceptions and should be clear to all parties clh

soc.religion.christian	major views of the trinity with frank s permission i have added some information here and in one case changed the order of his contributions in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views my comments are based primarily on william rusch s historical summary in the trinitarian controversy fortress i m going to save this as an faq clh major views of the trinity second century the writers of the nd cent are important because they set up much of the context for the later discussions justin martyr aristides athenagoras tatian and theophilus of antioch are known as the apologists their theology has often been described as logos theology based strongly on wording in john they took more or less a two phase approach through eternity the logos was with the father as his mind or thought this immanent word became expressed as god revealed himself in history ultimately in jesus thus jesus full distinction from the father only became visible in history though the logos had been present in god from eternity rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position but in a form which is less sophisticated because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the godhead irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the apologists however he was uncomfortable with the two stage approach he still viewed god as one personage with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self revelation the economy the distinctions are present in his essential nature irenaeus emphasized the holy spirit more than the apologists irenaeus views should probably be called economic trinitarianism though that term is normally used as below to refer to later developments third century clh dynamic monarchianism source theodotus adherents paul of samosota artemon socinus modern unitarians perception of god s essence the unity of god denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person the son and the holy spirit therefore are consubstantial with the father s divine essence only as impersonal attributes the divine dunamis came upon the man jesus but he was not god in the strict sense of the word perception of god s subsistence the notion of a subsistent god is a palpable impossibility since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible the diversity of god is apparent and not real since the christ event and the work of the holy spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within god not to a hypostatic union asignation of deity eternality father unique originator of the universe he is eternal self existent and without beginning or end son a virtuous but finite man in whose life god was dynamically present in a unique way christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified holy spirit an impersonal attribute of the godhead no deity or eternality is ascribed to the holy spirit criticism s elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the trinity categorically denies the deity of christ and of the holy spirit thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation in summary this probably best thought of as not being trinitarianism at all god is an undifferentiated one son and holy spirit are seen as simply names for the man jesus and the grace of god active in the church clh modalistic monarchianism source praxeas adherents noatus sabellius swedenborg scleiermacher united pentecostals jesus only perception of god s essence the unity of god is ultra simplex he is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person this essence may be designated interchangeably as father son and holy spirit they are different names for but identical with the unified simplex god the three names are the three modes by which god reveals himself perception of god s subsistence the concept of a subsistent god is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of god s modalistic manifesting of himself the paradox of a subsisting three in oneness is refuted by recognizing that god is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama asignation of deity eternality father fully god and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary god son full deity eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one god and identical with his essence he is the same god manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role incarnation holy spirit eternal god only as the tile designates the phase in which the one god in temporal sequence manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification criticism s depersonalizes the godhead to compensate for its trinitarian deficiencies this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical its concept of successive manifestations of the godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at christ s baptism rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy there are actually two slightly different groups included noetus and his followers and sabellius noetus was apparently more extreme sabellius followed him and attempted to use some features of economic trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view unfortunately information about sabellius comes from a century later and there seems to be some confusion between him and marcellus of ancyra clh i ve moved the following description to be with the other third century views it originally appeared near the end clh economic trinitarianism source hippolytus tertullian adherents various neo economic trinitarians perception of god s essence the godhead is characterized by triunity father son and holy spirit are the three manifestations of one identical indivisible substance the perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest triadic deeds as creation and redemption perception of god s subsistence subsistence within the godhead is articulated by means of such terms as distinction and distribution dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division asignation of deity eternality the equal deity of father son and holy spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational operational features of the godhead co eternality at times does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view but it seems to be a logical implication criticism s is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the trinity note that this is a development of the apologists and irenaeus as mentioned above as with them the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that god revealed himself in history however they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the godhead from the beginning tertullian talks of the father son and holy spirit as being three that are one in substance many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox but with less developed philosophical categories clh origen developing further an approach started by clement attempted to apply neo platonism to christian thought he set many of the terms of the coming battle in platonic fashion he sees the son as a mediator mediating between the absolute one of god and the plurality of creating beings the son is generated but he is eternally generated that is the relationship between father and son is eternal it cannot be said that there was once when he was not a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries having the son is intrinsic to his concept of god the father and son are described as separate hypostases though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts the union is one of love and action but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios of the same substance the holy spirit is also an active personal substance originated by the father through the son origen s intent is trinitarian not tritheistic but he pushes things in the direction of separateness fourth century clh subordinationism often called arianism clh source arius major adherents modern jehovah s witnesses and several other lesser known cults perception of god s essence the inherent oneness of god s nature is properly identifiable with the father only the son and the holy spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence perception of god s subsistence the unipersonal essence of god precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a godhead threeness in oneness is self contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic god asignation of deity eternality father the only one unbegotten god who is eternal and without beginning son a created being and therefore not eternal though he is to be venerated he is not of the divine essence holy spirit a nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the father he is viewed as an influence an expression of god deity is not ascribed to him criticism s it is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both christ and the holy spirit its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the father christ and the holy spirit this results in a totally confused soteriology note also that in most versions of this view the son is not fully human either he is supernatural and sinless that distinguishes this view from adoptionism clh orthodox trinitarianism source athanasius adherents basil gregory of nyssa gregory of nazianzus augustine thomas aquinas luther calvin contemporary orthodox christianity perception of god s essence god s being is perfectly unified and simplex of one essence this essence of deity is held in common by father son and holy spirit the three persons are consubstantial coinherent co equal and co eternal perception of god s subsistence the divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases as such the godhead exists undivided in divided persons this view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the godhead asignation of deity eternality in its final distillation this view unhesitatingly sets forth father son and holy spirit as co equal and co eternal in the godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function criticism s the only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of three in oneness at least in the th cent there were several different approaches all of which fit the description here and all regarded as orthodox but which are somewhat different in detail nicea was originally held to respond to arius arius can be thought of as carrying origen s thought a bit too far to the point of making the son a separate entity in general the east tended to take an approach based on origen s and it was hard to get acceptance of nicea in the east its final acceptance was based on the work of athanasius with the cappadocians gregory of nyssa and gregory of nazianzus among others while starting with three they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single god this allowed the council of constantinople in to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia clh

soc.religion.christian	re being right about messiahs in article geneva rutgers edu desiree bradley mindlink bc ca desiree bradley writes i must have missed the postings about waco david koresh and the second coming how does one tell if a second coming is the real thing unless the person claiming to be it is obviously insane first by his fruits the messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth he also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin fallen nature and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin he also wants to create world peace based on godism the messiah s teachings will build on the foundation of the bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of god the fall of man the purpose of creation and god s providence of restoration it will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the world s religions many christians expect jesus to come on literal clouds so they may miss him when he returns just as the jewish people missed jesus years ago they are still waiting for his first coming the jewish people of that age expected elijah to come first jesus said that john the baptist was elijah but john the baptist denied that he was elijah how did this reflect on jesus later in prison john even questioned who jesus was is he the one who is to come or do we look for another see book of matthew i m not saying that david koresh is the second coming of christ how could somebody who breaks his word be the second coming koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast he didn t still it seems to me that he did fool some people david koresh didn t even come close the problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real messiah when he does show up and from my meagre knowledge of the bible it seems that christians have been hard on the jews of christ s day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn t accept as the messiah so i was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the second coming while at the same time not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be god very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for christians how to recognize the second coming the messiah should not claim to be god what sets a messiah apart is that he is born without original sin he is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth adam and eve were born sinless but they fell and this tragedy meant that it would take god thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as god originally intended god s restoration providence is still not complete the messiah is the true son of god one with god god s representative on the earth but not god himself there is only one god mark and then if any one says to you look here is the christ or look there he is do not believe it mark and then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory my understanding of jesus answer is that unlike his first coming which was veiled the second coming will be quite unmistakeable by the way from koresh s public statement it s not so clear to me that he is claiming to be christ who else in this world is claiming to be the messiah maybe he s already here mike

to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell there s nothing like a preacher to put fear into an ignorant man if god hadn t created hell in the first place there d be no no need to die and save us isn t it also a bit paradoxical to say god died when in fact no such thing is remotely possible can the infinite die your using th century concepts to interprete st century writers of course in your termonology god could not cease to exist however that is not what death ever means in the scriptures if you will study the word you will see that it signifies separation death is separation not ceastation this is the reason for the agony of the cross for the first time in eternity one member of the godhead was separated from the other two i once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived she was as personable as any saint ever imagined she was to become my girlfriend for several years however having been drafted we were separated by distance to me that was a form of death later she decided that she couldn t wait for me to come home and bid me adue that to me was death it was separation from that which had made me whole death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from his fellowship not because he chose to send you into outer darkness but because you chose to go there did you know that jesus talked more about hell than he did about heaven thank you for this info what respect i had for the man now has been diminished tenfold i promise never again to say how wise or loving this man was when i rebelled against my earthly father he spanked me i found no wisdom in that until i had grown older and especially until i had my own children he was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if i continued on my suicidal course he did it in love though i interpreted it as harsh and unloving if god warns of impending danger that is love if choose to let us do as we please and then at the end tell us the rules that would be harsh you have a conscience no matter how calused or fallen it is that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear being jesus was allegedly god i doubt he could honestly feel the pinpricks man dealt him this may give light to the error of your understanding one must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith faith and knowledge are inseparable jesus most certainly felt the pinpricks of life as the scripture say heb for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin the kenosis passage of phil states that he gave up his godhead attributes when he took upon himself humanity it has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this it was to be my phd thesis the consciousness of christ i have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study including clh it is my conclussion that as jesus the nd member of the trinity actually suffered as we do he became part of the human race and experienced it as we do he grew in knowledge he chose not to grasp his omniscience but chose to be taught it is my understanding that he was led of the spirit to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between jesus the man and jesus as god but in jn where the adulterous women was thrown before him the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took him by surprise that is he was not aware that this event was to take place in time he was living sequential history as you or i maybe some other time we can discuss this but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not thanks again for the info just so you know some friends and i are starting a freethinkers organization and i m going to use some of the info you provided for an organization intro duction i was once a member of that club the free thinker is a glorious ideal by contrast of course you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic inhibited reactionary and repressive i find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd if the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a christian or a buddhist or a marxist that is his right but what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his rational doubt when in fact he was led to it by his faith he must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a free thinker to criticize the christian it might equally be a rational doubt for the christian to criticize him as a humanist if there is no faith there can be no dout there is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith pascal pointed out that sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive few speak dubiously of scepticism the fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else the person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths will be the devoted adherent of another in fact it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms hence the term a theist some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism in my campus ministry i ran across this more times than i care to remember however they disproved their own argument with every thought every word every point of logic that they used every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent that is to say that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary next time you re in a room of skeptics yell out look your fly is undone each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism to stress this is to belabor the obvious but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity the answer to this impasse lies in a rd way of knowing one which is based on presuppositions but if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral in other words another myth presuppositions my friend it is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt our own assumptions presuppostions even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence i tell you what if god condemns me for being honest he is unworthy of my worship better to burn in hell than to serve a tyrant in heaven of course that is hardly an original statement milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia it was even used in the first highlander movie but again your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of god you are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology not what he has revealed of himself through history through his prophets through his word and lastly but most of all thru his son if you are to reject god s annointed savior then reject him from a correct understanding of himself rex

also concede that i was doubly remiss as i asserted no reasonable alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist i also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily specify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description of the phenomena in question am i mistaken with this understanding yes to some degree there was an excellent discussion in sci skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago i hope it did not escape your notice the correct word is likely there is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct theories are backed up by evidence but not proved no theory can be true in a mathematical sense however theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena it is extremely important to test whether theories can predict something new or not yet observed all successful theories science has come up with have passed this test including the big bang theory of cosmic evolution the theory of natural selection etc it does not mean they must be correct but they are not mere best fits for the data but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to faith well yes if you want to believe in them this is not what science requires take a good look at the theory and the evidence see if the theory has made any successful predictions and use your reason disbelievers are not punished the fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive with out conclusive evidence we are left with faith this is what puzzles me why do we need to have faith in anything my fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist someone who is unable to believe ie fails to entertain any belief in god yes i know that one can t believe without god s help luther makes this quite clear in his letter to erasmus i m afraid this does not change my situation a couple of paragraphs deleted summary we ask why does the universe exist i think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing deletions the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don t exist don t exist tautology at its best carefully examine the original question and then the counter question the first asks why while the second is a request for definition no it is not although it does look like one this is a true dichotomy either something exists or nothing exists if nothing exists nobody would ask why if something exists it is possible to ask why but actually no existing being could give an answer imagine for a moment that the nobodies in non existence could also ask why nothing exists this is equivalent to my counter question why nothing exists in nothingness now why anything exists is equivalent to why something exists in somethingness this is what i meant with my tautology my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post i might add the worldview of things that exist do and things that don t don t is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable as does the theist s belief in god it is based on the assumption that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being a reason its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a reason i do indeed think there probably is no reason for being or existence in general for reasons i stated above however they will still leave open the question why this and not that and this is where theistic explanations come in science cannot give reasons for any particular human being s existence we come to this either i am therefore i am or i am for a reason this is a deep philosophical question is determinism true or not also is god deterministic or not i tend to think this question has no meaning in his case if i am for a reason i ve yet failed to see what it would be from our perspective it looks like i exist for truly random reasons i just rolled two dice why did i get and how can i believe there is any better reason for my existence if the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not a doctor if the latter your search is just beginning yes i am satisfied with this reason until i find something better my years of christianity were of no help in this respect i have to admit but i am patient another answer is that god is the source of all existence this sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this does not preclude his existence it only seeks to identify his qualities implying he exists to have qualities btw no it doesn t but i think an existing god cannot know why he exists for an answer to this question is not knowable of course this should not be any obstacle to belief in his existence i also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why it appears that m pihko agrees as we shall see but because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer it is impossible to know unknowable things however the question why do i exist in particular is not an invalid question this is not what i said but from our perspective it is impossible to tell and i can t just believe in any given explanation instead of another especially since i found i was deluding myself my apologies i was using why as why did this come to be why did pre existence become existence why did pre spacetime become spacetime i think pre existence is an oxymoron there is no time outside of this spacetime except in some other universe and from that perspective our universe never was it exists only for those who are inside it but we come to the admission that science fails to answer why because it can t be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid no the validity of the question has to be discussed separately i think philosophy is of great help here what can be known and what is not knowable m pihko does present a good point though we may need to ask what do i as an individual christian base my faith on will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what god said and continues to say in his word this is a very good question in trying to answer this and numerous other questions that bothered me i finally found nothing to base my faith on i think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves why do i believe or why i don t believe petri

time and it s not really intended for me but i couldn t resist a personal weakness of mine jerkius kneeus tragically incurable the foundation for faith in god is reason without which the existence of god could not be proven that his existence can be proven by reason is indisputable cf my short treatise traditional proofs for the existence of god and summa theologica not so i can prove that the existance of god is disputable by showing that people dispute it this is easy i dispute that god exists simple i missed your traditional proofs treatise but the proofs i remember from the summa theologic the ways i think it was were rather poor stuff the ontological argument is about a billion times better imho i would think you d want non traditional proofs considering the general failure of the traditional proofs at least the ones i know of i am thinking of the ontological argument the cosmological argument and the teleological argument those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names anyway now given that god exists and that his existence can be proven by reason i assert that his commands must be followed blindly although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith why this is the real question so to discuss it i ll assume god exists otherwise there is no heavenly authority to babble about because god is the first cause of all things the first mover of matter the independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence the measure of all that is perfect and the essential being who gives order to the universe logos please show this is the case i am familiar with the first cause argument and i ll accept for the sake of argument that there is a first cause even though i find some of its premices questionable the rest you ll have to show this includes that the first cause is god i next assert that god is all good got it i deny that god is all good so there if this is so then that which is contrary to the will of god is evil i e the absence of the good and since god can never contradict himself then by his promise of a savior as early as the protoevangelium of genesis god instructs that because a human adam was first responsible for man s alienation from the source of all good a man would be required to act to restore the friendship thus god became incarnate in the person of the messiah this isn t self consistent if humans must renew the relationship then god incarnate or not can t do it well unless you think god is human granted god made himself human but this is nonetheless cheating the intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused god fixing it even by indirect means contradicts this now this messiah claimed that he is the truth john if this claim is true then we are bound by reason to follow him who is truth incarnate why also why assume said claim is true anyway if i claim to be truth are you bound by reason to follow me you next seem to have a problem with authority have you tried the united states marine corps yet i can tell you first hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority undoubtably do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the marines without question you seem to imply this about god and that the marines are similar in this respect if this is not what you are trying to say they please explain what it is you are saying as i have missed it if you have not yet had the privilege i will reply that the authority which is truth incarnate may never be questioned and thus must be followed blindly why why not question it even if it is truth we cannot know this certainly so why is it so irrational to question perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong you assert that god is truth and we can t question truth but i assert that god is not truth and anyway we can question truth how is it my assertion is less good than yours one may not deny the truth oh i hereby deny i hope you ll agree is the truth granted i look pretty damn silly saying something like that but i needed something we d both agree was clearly true now you ll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag no heaven lighting bolts either no mysterious net outages i seem to be permited to say such things absurd or not for example when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newton s head he could have denied that it happened but he did not the laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not they are true they are certainly not true at least the ones newton derived are not true and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances we do not have a set of laws of physics that always works in all cases if we did physics would be over already science is all about questioning this sort of truth if we didn t we d still follow aristotle i d generalize this a little more if you want to learn anything new you must question the things you know tm because you can always be wrong therefore the authority which is truth may not be denied even presupposing that truth may not be denied and may not be questioned and that god is truth it only follows that god may not be denied or questioned not that he must be obeyed we could unquestioningly disobey him how annoying of us but you have not connected denial with disobedience dan no nickname johnson and god said jeeze this is dull and it was dull genesis these opinions probably show what i know

soc.religion.christian	re the arrogance of christians to what follows our moderator has already answered the charge of arrogance more ably that i could have done so so i will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic in a previous article eugene bigelow ebay sun com geno says if i don t think my belief is right and everyone else s belief is wrong then i don t have a belief this is simply what belief means unfortunatly this seems to be how christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion this is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is or was taught to think it is the fundamental premis a is not not a if a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible we should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word believe however the weak sense means i am not sure i believe tom went to the library but he could have gone to the track the strong sense means i am so certain that i use it as a basis of thought i believe that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws despite the fact that nature appears capricious and unpredictable christian belief is of the strong kind though christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topics some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the only one and if you don t accept their teachings then you won t be saved note that these are two separate ideas most hold the first view but the majority do not hold the second is is again a matter of pure logic that if christanity is true then hinduism for example must necessarilly be false insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with christaianity and as a matter of logic vice versa it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what god thinks wants it is arrogant to claim to know what anyone thinks or wants unless they have told you christians believe god has told us what he thinks and wants especially when it s based upon your interpretation of a book most christians do not base their belief on the bible but on the living tradition of the church established by christ and guided constantly by the holy spirit the bible is simply the written core of that tradition the logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can t both be correct if depends what you mean by differing if i believe tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs pounds our beliefs differ but we may both be right if i believe tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine one of us at least must be wrong it s all about perception no two people are exactly alike no two people perceive everything in the same way i believe that there is one truth call it god s truth a universal truth or call it what you will i don t believe god presents this truth i think it is just there and it s up to you to look for and see it through prayer meditation inspir ation dreams or whatever just because people may perceive this truth differently it doesn t mean one is wrong and the other is right thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being can find it you assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken in short you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong qed as an example take the question is the glass half empty or half full you can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct so for your belief to be true does not require everyone else s belief to be wrong here i begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth but simply with language saying that the glass is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full it is the same fact expressed in different words the whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the same fact it is of course quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words it is also true that they may fail to understand each other s words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart great scisms have occurred in just this way and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief this does not mean in any sense that all beliefs are equally valid since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away some of the beliefs that some people hold must necessarilly be false and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct but if y is equivalent to not x then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs we must each regard the other as in error mark baker the task is not to cut down jungles but aa freenet carleton ca to irrigate deserts c s lewis

soc.religion.christian	when are two people married listowner i have sent this to mr anderson privately post it only if you think it of general interest here is a copy of something i wrote for another list you may find it relevant a listmember asks what makes common law marriages wrong a common law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself there is nothing in the bible old or new testament about getting married by a preacher or by a priest jewish or christian and in fact jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings there is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman in fact the traditional christian view at least in the west is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage and that the clergyman is there only as a witness however the essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife forsaking all others till death do them part the reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society and the couple themselves may be clear about whether a commitment has been made suppose that we do away with the public ceremony the standard vows etc instead we have a man and a woman settling down to live together after a year or so the man says to the woman hey honey it was great while it lasted but i think it s time to move on she says what are you talking about he says i am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger she says but you can t we are married he says what are you talking about we never got married she says i remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made love you said my love for you is as deep as the ocean as eternal as the stars as long as i live i am yours utterly and completely when i lie on my deathbed my last feeble breath will utter your name my he says oh that that was just rhetoric just poetry when a man is in a romantic mood he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that you mustn t take them literally and that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record the church insists on it because it is her duty among other things to give moral advice and you cannot give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom if anybody and vice versa the state insists on it since the state has a concern with property rights with child care and support and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom prospective fathers in law insist on it because they don t want their daughters seduced and abandoned prospective spouses insist on it because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment or just poetry and persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric this is the real thing hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment the church goes further and insists that when christians marry a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the church not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the christian teaching about marriage is and that they are in fact promising to be married in a christian sense the church also prefers a standard marriage vow and is wary of letting couples write their own vows for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract certain language has been repeatedly used in wills and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it try to say the same thing in your own words and you may find that the probate judge s interpretation of them is not at all what you intended similarly the church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether you are my main squeeze and i am here for the long haul do in fact cover the same territory as forsaking all others and till death do us part this topic has come up on the list before is there any topic that hasn t one listmember was asking if a couple love each other and are living together isn t that marriage in the eyes of god eventually someone asked in that case what is their status if they break up is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce are they in a relationship that god forbids either of them to walk out on the original questioner said good grief i never thought of that in fact there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says we don t need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other is trying to have it both ways to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother at this point someone may say none of this applies to me and my mate we are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment for better or worse forsaking all others till death us do part so in our case no ceremony is needed to this my reply would be the reason for requiring a driver s license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road what is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers but the existence of dangerous drivers however testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road therefore the state rightly makes and enforces such laws and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are back to the original question we have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around years he asks at what point did they stop fornicating and start being married i answer at the point if any where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other for better or worse as long as they both lived if they have accepted such an obligation what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of say a justice of the peace yours james kiefer

soc.religion.christian	re sspx schism larry l overacker writes responding to simon i may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net my understanding is that sspx does not consider itself in schism or legitimately excommunicated but that s really beside the point what does the roman catholic church say excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication as provided for in canon law here s some of the theology involved for the interested there is confusion over this issue of the sspx s schism often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schism take the various classifications of obedience first there are important elements involved here for my purposes a command the response made to the command as far as the command goes commands can be legitimate such as the pope ordering catholics to not eat meat on fridays or they can be illegitimate such as the pope ordering catholics to worship the god dagon when every other full moon comes around as far as the response to a command goes it can be to refuse to do what is commanded or to comply making a table there are thus possibilites command response name legitimate comply true obedience illegitimate refuse true obedience legitimate refuse disobedience illegitimate comply false obedience so now you see where my classifications of obedience come from obedience is not solely a matter of compliance refusal the nature of the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to consider someone s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are obedient or disobedient you also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad in my example if the pope commands all catholics to worship the god dagon and they all refuse they aren t being disobedient at all as far as the society of saint pius x goes they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the pope desires but that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them disobedient you also have to consider the nature of the papal desires and there s the rub sspx says the popes since vatican ii have been commanding certain very bad things for the church the popes have of course disagreed so where are we are we in another arian heresy complete with weak popes or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers well the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the traditional teaching of the church is the problem here is that very few catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on and what the issues are the religion of american catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth you will never read about the issues being discussed in the catholic press in this country on the other hand one italian catholic magazine i get days has had interviews with the superior general of the society of saint pius x many catholics will decide to side with the pope there is some soundness in this because the papacy is infallible so eventually some pope will straighten all this out but on the other hand there is also unsoundness in this in that in the short term the popes may indeed be wrong and such catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they re wrong in fact if the situation is grave enough they sin in obeying him at the very least they re wasting a great opportunity because they are failing to love christ in a heroic way at the very time that he needs this badly schism let s move on to schism what is it schism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command all schismatics are disobedient but it s a superset so it doesn t work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics the mere fact that the sspx priests don t comply with the holy father s desires doesn t make them schismatics so what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism maybe this something else makes the sspx priests schismatics you must add this the rejection of the right to command look in any decent reference on catholic theology and that s what you ll find the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command here s what the catholic encyclopedia says for example not every disobedience is a schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the trangression of the commands of superiors denial of their divine right to command from the ce article schism is the society of saint pius x then schismatic the answer is a clear no they say that the pope is their boss they pray for him every day and that s all that matters as far as schism goes what all this boils down to is this if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections their position is a legitimate one as far as the catholic theology of obedience and schism goes they are resisting certain papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the papacy and the best interests of the church in fact someone who finds himself in this situation has a duty to resist now what is the stance of rome on all this well if you read the holy father s motu proprio ecclesia dei you can find out it s the definitive document on the subject a motu proprio is a specifically papal act it s not the product of a roman congregation a letter that the pope has possibly never even read it s from the pope himself his boss is god there s no one else to complain to in this document the holy father says among other things the episcopal consecrations performed by archbishop lefebvre constituted a schismatic act archbishop lefebvre s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of tradtion both are confusing i fail to see the logic of the pope s points as far as the episcopal consecrations go i read an interesting article in a translation of the italian magazine si si no no it all gets back to the question of jurisdiction if episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the pope s jurisdiction then they would truly constitute a schismatic act justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law but my problem with this is this according to the traditional theology of holy orders episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction it only confers the power of order the ability to confect the sacraments jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the pope the society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacraments that require a bishop the si si no no article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the pope said what he did is that he has a novel post vatican ii idea of holy orders according to this idea episcopal consecration does confer jurisdiction i lent the article to a friend unfortunately so can t tell you more i believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea the pope s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me there s no way there is a schism according to traditional catholic theology so why does the pope think this as far as the points regarding the nature of tradition goes here s the passage in question the root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of tradtion incomplete because it does not take sufficiently into the account the living character of tradition which as the second vatican council clearly taught comes from the apostles and progresses in the church with the help of the holy spirit there is a growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on this comes about in various ways it comes through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts it comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience and it comes from the preaching of those who have received along with their right of succession in the espiscopate the sure charism of truth but especially contradictory is a notion of tradition which opposes the universal magisterium of the church possessed by the bishop of rome and the body of bishops it is impossible to remain faithful to the tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom in the person of the apostle peter christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in his church papal motu proprio ecclesia dei july it seems to me that the holy father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following vatican council ii has happened i am the pope the argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that archbishop lefebvre must be wrong because he disagrees with them this is weak to say the least it would have helped clarify things more if the pope had addressed archbishop lefebvre s concerns in detail what is john paul ii s stand on the social kingship of christ as taught by gregory xvi pius ix leo xiii pius xi and pius xii for example are we supposed to ignore what all these popes said on the subject i don t know what the future will hold but the powers that be in the sspx are still talking with rome and trying to straighten things out many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey justified disobedience or even obeying god rather than man calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of alice in wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean similarly schism indicates a formal break in the church if the pope says that a schism exists it seems to me that by definition it exists it may be that the pope is on the wrong side of the break that there is no good reason for the break to exist and that it will shortly be healed but how can one deny that it does in fact exist it seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform the power of the papacy what good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the pope in the future but in the process you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline it s one thing to hold that the pope has misused his powers and excommunicated someone wrongly it s something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect and the schism is all in his imagination that means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools but acts whose validity is open to debate generally it has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the pope while they have often objected to church sanctions generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist you are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying and to be in communion while excommunicated this would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to command that you say defines schism clh

soc.religion.christian	re certainty and arrogance in an earlier article i explained that what many people find arrogant about christians is that some christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines that is many christians insist that they cannot have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs which amounts to saying that they are infallible impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant most of us will probably agree in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect so long as your own brain is involved there is a possibility for error i summarised the problem by writing there is no way out of the loop someone called rexlex has claimed that there is a way out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism as i have explained to him before you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads the facts do not change just because you dislike them rexlex wrote i disagree with dr nancy s sweetie s conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair however as any first year philosophy student can explain what rexlex has written does not constitute a refutation all he has said is that he does not like what i wrote he has done nothing at all to dispute it there were two sentences in rexlex s post that seemed relevant to the point at hand there is such a thing as true truth and it is real it can be experienced and it is verifiable i do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience i have for example direct experience of adding numbers i don t claim to be infallible at it in fact i remember doing sums incorrectly but i do claim that i have direct experience of reasoning about numbers however once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them we are on much shakier ground that was the point of the earlier article human brains are infested with sin and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances it is only because of god s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing but how far does that get you once god s revelation stops and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears for example let s suppose that our modern bible translations include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper and that jesus said exactly this is my body we ll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true what can we be certain of not much at the moment he stops speaking and people start interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean that literally or not we do not have any record that he elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran or con substatiation he didn t say we interpret this passage using our brains we think and reason and draw conclusions but we know that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us wrong this is something that most of us have direct experience of why should anyone believe that his reasoning which he knows to be fallible can lead him to perfect conclusions so given the assumptions in this example what we can be certain of is that jesus said this is my body beyond that once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what christ revealed we get into trouble unless you are infallible there are very few things you can be certain of to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking they cannot be certain that is the problem of seeming arrogant the non christians around us know that human beings make mistakes just as surely as we know it they do not believe we are infallible any more than we do when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we are infallible the non christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying to cover them up i think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only very confident of for example we might say that we know our sin for recognising sin is something we directly experience but other things whether based on reasoning from scripture or extra biblical thinking should not be labled as infallible we should say that we are very confident of them and be ready to explain our reasoning but so far as i am aware none of us is infallible speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous rexlex suggested that people read he is there and he is not silent by francis schaeffer i didn t think very highly of it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many evangelical christians somebody else might like it though so don t let my opinion stop you from reading it if someone is interested in my opinion i d suggest on certainty by ludwig

k who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers i ve been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs i m female yesterday i counted and realized that on seven different occasions i ve been sexually harrassed at this company seven times eight years yesterday was the most recent one someone left an x rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer i m really upset by this i suppose it could have been worse it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something there was no note i do not know if it was someone s idea of an innocent joke that went awry someone s sick idea of flirting an act of emotional terrorism that worked i dreaded coming back to work today what if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question i don t know the answer so i take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep i generally have a bible on my desk for occasional inspiration what if i open it up to corinthians and find a picture a la the north american man boy love association i want to throw up just thinking about this stuff i can lock up my desk but i can t lock up every book i have in the office i can t trust that someone won t shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when i m not looking so that i go home to find such a picture or a threat or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body to make it worse the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch the appointed hour for leaving was i was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch so i returned at only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch they left at or so no one could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my number was posted so i came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and i was the sole survivor this despite the fact that everyone knew how bad i felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer i need some prayers i can t stop crying i am so deeply wounded that it s ridiculous i feel like i m some kind of sub human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act i feel like i m a sub human piece of garbage that s not worthy of a simple phone call saying we re leaving for mary s lunch a little early so that bob can get back for a big meeting please pray that my resentments will either go away or be miraculously turned into something positive please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop and find some healing for him or herself please pray for my being healed from this latest wound which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds please pray that i can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions this company in my opinion has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn t tolerated but when you get right down to it how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately left obsene or threatening notes left obscene pictures spoken to lewdly etc seven times in eight years in the same place pretty words from the company do me no good when i m terrified or healing from the latest assault and please pray that i don t turn into an automaton because of this that s my bad habit ignore it and it will go away you re not worth anyone s time so don t go talking to anyone about this you re right you are a sub human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way you are just an object you prostitute your mind to this company so why can t others expect you to prostitute your body there as well what makes you think women aren t just possessions and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act this is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode please pray that these thoughts don t come into my head and stay there triggering depression please pray that this latest trauma doesn t come between me and god in a way a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to god and it s also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from god i know god doesn t drop me from his loving hand but it s awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand look down think i m falling and forget that god s still holding on to me although this probably isn t entirely appropriate for this newsgroup i really can use the kind of loving support you all provide for this reason i hope good mr moderator allows me this latest indulgence after all he s allowed me the thermometer note and

soc.religion.christian	re sspx schism in article apr geneva rutgers edu shellgate llo uu psi com larry l overacker writes you ask where we are i would echo that question i m not trying to be contentious but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions what prevents me from choosing any doctrine i like and saying that papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time this is especially true since councils of bishops have basically stood by the pope the ultimate question is the traditional theology of the church this is the only thing that it is possible to resist a pope for his departure from the traditional doctrine of the church if commands from any authority conflict with tradition the commands must be disobeyed my own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way god would never allow a hair splitting situation to develop it would be too complex for people to figure out i don t view the present situation in the church as anything extremely complicated run through a list of what has happened in the last years in the catholic church and any impartial observer will be aghast it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline the problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the catholic faith in my opinion most catholics know about zilch about the catholic faith this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops it s basically the reformation part ii there is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the catholic church are currently being trampled upon by the catholic hierarchy i could go on listing shocking things for an hour probably take the situation in campos brazil for example i m reading a book on what happened there after vatican council ii the bishop antonio de castro mayer never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of vatican ii he kept the traditional mass the same old catechisms etc he made sure the people knew their faith the catholic theology of obedience what modernism was etc he innoculated the people against what was coming well one day the order came from rome for his retirement it came when the pope was sick bishop de castro mayer waited until the pope recovered then inquired whether this command was what the pope really wanted or something that some liberal had commanded in his absence the pope confirmed the decision so the good bishop retired the injustice that followed was completely incredible a new bishop was installed he proceeded to expel most of bishop de castro mayer s clergy from their churches because they refused to celebrate the new mass the new bishop would visit a parish and celebrate a new mass the people would promptly walk out of the church en masse the bishop was enraged by this he usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church the priests would just start building new churches the people were completely behind them the old parishes had the new mass as the bishop desired and virtually no parishioners the prime motivation for all this was completely illegal according to canon law no priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional mass because of legislation enacted by pope saint pius v nor is there any obligation to say the new mass during all this process the people of campos not just private individuals but including civil authorities were constantly sending petitions and letters to rome to do something about the new modernist bishop nothing was ever done no help ever arrived from rome eventually priests were kicked out and about people my question to the supporters of sspx is this is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the pope assuming that the pope s position does not change and that the leaders of sspx don t jointly make such choice if not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority if i adopt the view that i m not wrong i can t be wrong and there s no way i ll change my mind you must change yours that i ve either left the catholic church or it has left me if the pope defines certain things ex cathedra that would be the end of the controversy that process is all very well understood in catholic theology and anyone who doesn t go along with it is an instant non catholic the problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the catholic world if they knew the faith and what our bishops are doing they would be shocked we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teaching of the church is if this were a simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over years this isn t the case in the catholic church there is a massive body of traditional teaching the popes of the last years are especially relevant there is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is i thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term i may be wrong here i m not roman catholic that s heresy more or less although they have done a great job since the reformation the last years have seen so many errors spread that it s pitiful infallibility rests in the pope and in the church as a whole in the short term a pope or large sections of the church can go astray in fact that s what usually happens during a major heresy large sections of the church go astray the pope historically has been much more reliable everything will always come back in the long run what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation would it be honored if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again i m not trying to be contentions i m trying to understand since i m orthodox i ve got no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other yes it would be honored infallibility is infallibility but what is he going to define that the new mass is a better expression of the catholic faith than the old that sex education in the catholic schools is wonderful that all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the popes prior to vatican ii it does if the command was legitimate sspx does not view the pope s commands as legitimate why this is a very slippery slope not really start studying the major catholic theologians of the last years everything is very well spelled out the west excels at critical thought remember that s what catholic theologians have been busy at for centuries

soc.religion.christian	re certainty and arrogance darren dr nancy s sweetie kilroy gboro rowan edu writes darren in an earlier article i explained that what many people find darren arrogant about christians is that some christians profess darren absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines and darren in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources darren are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own darren thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect the point that darren raises is a very lutheran viewpoint while reason is a gift from god it is also infected by sin yet we do not reject reason entirely and neither i think does darren we need reason as darren himself has pointed out to comprehend god s revelation of himself in the bible but reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the word we need first and foremost faith for the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to god s law nor can it do so romans luther accepted scripture as the sole means of revelation sola scriptura but accepted the necessity of the use of reason with faith in comprehending that revelation yet luther also said regarding baptism but mad reason rushes forth and because baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do regards it as worthless large catechism fourth part baptism to make matters more complicated luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an absolutist i ve seen him described as a take no prisoners theologian we might conclude given these observations that luther was inconsistent or mad and surely at least some have come to that conclusion but it might be useful to recall that jesus was also called mad and peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on pentecost so we as christians ought to be careful about rejecting luther or others as mad rather we should imitate the bereans who examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul said was true acts the basis for the confidence with which luther peter paul and many others preached the gospel was not just reason but faith and the holy spirit this is not faith divorced from reason but a faith that guides informs and uses reason the spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly god does not want us to preach the message that i think that jesus might have risen from the dead but rather i know that my redeemer lives job the christian does not side with pilate in saying what is truth but rather follows christ who said in fact for this reason i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth everyone on the side of truth listens to me john we can know the truth because god has promised us that we can know the truth jesus said if you hold to my teachings you are really my disciples then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free john the proverbs urge us buy the truth and do not sell it pr the psalmist prayed do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth ps evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact in his mouth yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self glorification but if we present the truth as the teachings of scripture revealed by the spirit and not our own invention and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of scripture as luther did then we are not arrogant but humble we should humbly trust in god s promise of truth just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness rexlex it is only because of god s own revelation that we can be rexlex absolute about a thing darren but how far does that get you once god s revelation stops darren and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears i agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of scripture and the products of our own reason even when such reasoning is based on scripture however i think i would draw the line of distinction more reasonably and less academically than you would darren for example let s suppose that our modern bible translations darren include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper darren and that jesus said exactly this is my body darren we ll presume that what he said was totally without error and darren absolutely true what can we be certain of not much darren at the moment he stops speaking and people start darren interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean darren that literally or not we do not have any record that he darren elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran or con darren substantiation he didn t say darren is almost at the point of making a very lutheran statement about the lord s supper the lutheran approach is to say that if jesus said this is my body then that is what we should believe other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in scripture recall that jesus words do not stand alone on this subject we also have paul s words in corinthians in which he passed on to us what he received from the lord in particular he said for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lord s death until he comes by these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the lord s supper really is bread as well as the lord s body as our senses in fact tell us does this prove that tran substantiation is false i suppose someone could say that paul spoke metaphorically of the lord s body as bread simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it but this thought is found nowhere in scripture so we reject it thus the primary reason for rejecting tran substantiation is not that we can prove it false but that it is simply not found in scripture side remark i ve been told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence is con substantiation but it has been non lutherans who have told me this we tend not to use the word i almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion who need labels to compare catholic lutheran and reformed teachings on the lord s supper but almost every church wants to call their own teaching real presence because that was the traditional teaching of the church end side remark darren when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning darren can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we darren are infallible the non christians around us rarely believe darren that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when darren the person you are talking to believes that you are either too darren foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying darren to cover them up this is precisely why christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing it is far better to take the approach i d like to show you what scripture says you decide for yourself whether to believe it or not darren rexlex suggested that people read he is there and he is not darren silent by francis schaeffer i didn t think very highly of darren it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many darren evangelical christians somebody else might like it though darren so don t let my opinion stop you from reading it darren if someone is interested in my opinion i d suggest on darren certainty by ludwig wittgenstein as long as we re trading references i d like to suggest dr siegbert becker s paperback the foolishness of god the place of reason in lutheran theology published by northwestern publishing house this book was based on becker s doctoral thesis at the university of chicago david wagner not by might nor by power a confessional lutheran but by my spirit says the lord almighty zechariah

the russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties the memoirs of many russian officers who served in the east at this time

safe heaven in turkiye today x soviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by x soviet armenia today x soviet armenia covers up the

europe especially spain by saintly christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers to one brought up as most americans have been in the gladstonian and foreign missionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate he also stated that they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population i want

knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the ottoman empire and to assist instead other invading russian armies their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in at the beginning of world war i the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman s enemy increased drastically ottoman supply

on just right in while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration camps the armenian volunteers in germany formed the first armenian battalion to fight alongside the nazis in this battalion had grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of the former guerilla leader dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the short lived armenian dictatorship and the architect of the cold blooded genocide of million turks and kurds between an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin which was recognized by the nazis encouraged by this the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler s policy of extermination of the jews this armenian nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an encore performance staged by the armenians during wwi when they back stabbed and exterminated million turks by colluding with the invading russian army furthermore as mccarthy put it the armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros armistice with the allies october the allies had decided to create a greater armenia including the old russian province of yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of anatolia claimed by the armenian fanatics only the area called cilicia around the ottoman province of adana was to be excluded as it had already been claimed by the french the allies quickly set about attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks who could be expected to oppose their plans on april the british army occupied kars gave civilian and military power over to the armenians then withdrew the british planned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship even though the russian pre war census had shown kars province to be over muslim the turks of kars were effectively disarmed but the british could not disarm the kurds of the mountains the fate of the turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in eastern anatolia murder pillage genocide and the destruction of turkish homes and entire turkish villages drove the turks of kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the ottoman army the british had left the scene to the armenian genocide squads therefore few europeans were present to observe the genocide one british soldier colonel rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of otoman soldiers saw what was occurring rawlinson wired to his superiors in the interest of humanity the armenians should not be left in independent command of the moslim population as their troops being

jonas flygare writes i get the impression hasan realized he goofed and is now trying to drop the thread let him it might save some miniscule portion of his sorry face not really since i am a logical person who likes furthering himself from any name calling i started trashing any article that contains such abuses without responding to and sometimes not even reading articles written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company ah but in my followup on the subject which you by the way never bothered responding to there was no name calling hence the assumption do you feel more up to it now so that we might have an answer or to refresh your memory does the human right issue in the area apply to palestinians only also do you claim there is such a thing as forfeiting a human right if that s possible then explain to the rest of us how there can exist any such thing use your logic and convince us this is your golden chance jonas flygare well ok let s see what master of wisdom mr jonas flygare wrote that can be wisdomely responded to are you calling names or giving me a title if the first read your paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again master of wisdom writes in mar frej teknikum uu se hasan flax hasan in case you didnot know palestineans were there for months and they are coming back when you agree to give palestineans their human rights afterall human rights arenot negotiable correct me if i m wrong but isn t the right to one s life also a human right or does it only apply to palestinians no it is everybody s right however when a killer kills then he is giving up willingly or unwillingly his life s right to the society the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by depriving the killer off his life s right so then it s all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis the old eye for an eye thinking funny i thought modern legal systems were made to counter exactly that so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom if you insist on giving me names titles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i m merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my point in the post that you responded to the point is that since israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the occupied palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society if a state can deprive all it s citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all in conjugtion with the above when a group of people occupies others territories and rule them by force then this group would be willingly or unwillingly deprived from some of its rights such as the right to live that s nice the swedish government is a group of people that rule me by force does that give me the right to kill them do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here worthy or not i was just applying your logic to a related problem am i to assume you admit it wouldn t hold what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law us law israeli law and now it s very convenient to start using the legal system to prove a point excuse me while i throw up ok master of wisdom is throwing up you people stay away from the screen while he is doing it oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone i ll let you in on a secret it s not for real take my word for it it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories anyway as for hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won t repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i m eagerly awaiting your reply joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out davar september courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that s the english translations if you have other information i d be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i m not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it s fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region ever it s those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over and willing to give in order to get something back we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction guess where that takes your logic to never never land the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your posts any

joel don t do this to me mate i m only a poor plant scientist i don t know how to make kill files my k key works overtime as it is just to then what seems to be the problem did you ever read newspaper at all painful search the gruesome extent of february s killings of azeris by armenians in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan about men women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four year war over nagorny karabakh the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates the february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four year campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief stricken azerbaijan s wild and contradictory allegations of up to dead the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali disaster said his figure of people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov the mayor of hojali an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may dead people named and more than bodies reported unidentified this figure of nearly dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the international red cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of bodies received at his mosque from hojali most of them civilians we did not count the bodies but the figure seems reasonable it is no fantasy mr zen ruffinen said we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre don t get worked up it will take several months to get a final figure the year old lawyer said at his small office mr rasulov knows about these things it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that people were killed and wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january those nationalists the popular front finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians officially people have so far been certified as dead being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic s forensic department this is just a small percentage of the dead said rafiq youssifov the republic s chief forensic scientist they were the only bodies brought to us remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within hours of these people were women and were children under years old gunshots killed people shrapnel killed and axes or blunt instruments killed exposure in the highland snows killed the last three thirty three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor youssifov s report those bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed mr rasulov said files from mr rasulov s investigative commission are still disorganised lists of azeri militiamen are dead here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of corpses brought to be washed in just one day the most heartbreaking account from witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on february there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly in hojali people by the stream and the road and visible around nakhchivanik village mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot people waved up to us for help we saw three dead children and one two year old alive by one dead woman the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces the independent london heroes who fought on amid the bodies aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe bar on the caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of hojali just over three months ago writes hugh pope i m still wearing the same clothes i don t have any others the year old carpenter said beginning his account of the hojali disaster i was wounded in five places but i am lucky to be alive mr sadikov and his wife were short of food without electricity for more than a month and cut off from helicopter flights for days they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the to people left in the straggling azeri town on the edge of karabakh at about pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before eight or nine kinds of weapons artillery heavy machine guns the lot mr sadikov said soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town down a hill through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side to escape the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam about miles away they thought they were going to make it until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak none of my group was hurt up to then then we were spotted by a car on the road and the armenian outposts started opening fire mr sadikov said azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians but their efforts were mostly in vain mr sadikov said only people from his group of made it through including his wife and militiaman son seven of his immediate relations died including his year old elder brother i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat he said pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes we have never got any of the bodies back the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire one hero of the evacuation alif hajief was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group s crossing mr sadikov said another hero elman memmedov the mayor of hojali said he and several others spent the whole day of february in the bushy hillside surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee the night after we reached

even reading articles written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company deleted stuff well ok let s see what master of wisdom mr jonas flygare wrote that can be wisdomely responded to are you calling names or giving me a title if the first read your paragraph above if not i accept the title in order to let you get into the um well debate again i didnot know that master of wisdom can be name clling too unless you consider yourself deserve less master of wisdom writes in mar frej teknikum uu se hasan flax hasan in case you didnot know palestineans were there for months and they are coming back when you agree to give palestineans their human rights afterall human rights arenot negotiable correct me if i m wrong but isn t the right to one s life also a human right or does it only apply to palestinians no it is everybody s right however when a killer kills then he is giving up willingly or unwillingly his life s right to the society the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by depriving the killer off his life s right so then it s all right for israel to kill the people who kill israelis the old eye for an eye thinking funny i thought modern legal systems were made to counter exactly that so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you master of wsidom if you insist on giving me names titles i did not ask for you could at least spell them correctly sigh that was only to confuse you ha ha ha hey when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i m merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for some most its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights what do you expect me to tell you master of wisdom when i did explain my point in the post that you responded to the point is that since israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the occupied palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society if a state can deprive all it s citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant what kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue the answer is to be found in a certain system such as international law us law israeli law deleted jonas was throwing up not for real so you can stick to the screen it seems that the us law represented by us state dept in this case is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories anyway as for hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won t repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i m eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be left only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren there is no other way out davar september courtesy of marc afifi just a question if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas charter that s the english translations if you have other information i d be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to a private paper even older i m not going to get into the question if he wrote the above but it s fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics guess what those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region more deleted stuff exactly you are right i guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with men like joseph weitz we and our either refers to zionists or jews i donot know which well i can give you an answer you master of wisdom i will not suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem i think that is fair enough no that is not an answer since i asked for a system that could solve the problem you said any could be used then you provided a contradiction above you wrote that you understood what i meant underlined by any system can be used to solve the conflict but not any system would resolve it justly guess where that takes your logic to never never land you are proving yourself as a first you understood what i meant but then you claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic too bad for you the master of wisdom the greatest problem of zionism is arab children rabbi shoham oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are a real bummer when i try giving your posts any credit why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in if you were a zionists if you believe in zionist codes and acts well i feel sorry for you because the same rabbi shoham had said yes zionism is racism if you feel ashamed and bothered by the zionist codes then drop zionism if you are not zionist why are you bothered then you should join me in condemning these racist zionist codes and acts hasan jonas flygare

its savage gangs is increasing news reporters make their living by providing stories and there is so way in hell that they are going to confuse the public with what is happening in armenia a country that few know of and risk detracting people s interest from what is happening in serbia then you must be living in an alternate universe where were they an appeal to mankind during the last three years azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the soviet union all humanitarian constitutional human rights guaranteed by the un charter universal declaration of human rights helsinki agreements human problems international forums documents signed by the soviet union all of them are violated the ussr s president government bodies do not defend azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace the strong army of armenian terrorists with moscow s tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against azerbaijan as a result a part of azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed hundreds of people killed thousands wounded some azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the armenian ssr their historical homeland together with them russians and kurds have also been driven out a part of them now settled in azerbaijan some turkish meskhetians lezghins and representatives of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the central asia where the president and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations one of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the armenian extremists destruction of the karabakh scientific experimental base of the institute of genetics and selection of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr we beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance for the honour and dignity of million azerbaijanis are violated its territory culture and history are trampled its people are shot there is persistent negative image of azerbaijanians abroad and this defamation is spread over the whole world by soviet mass media armenian lobby in the ussr and the united states one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on azerbaijan it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the issue of karabakh hundreds and thousands armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land had their representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan ssr we are for a united indivisible sovereign azerbaijan we are for a common caucasian home proclaimed in by one of the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic republic muhammed emin rasulzade but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the soviet leadership in favour of the armenian expansionists encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new year reich the great armenia by annexing the neighboring lands the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent but what about the lives of seven million human beings if these people are muslims does it mean that they are less valuable can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion by their residence or other attributes all people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding this is not the first appeal of azerbaijan to the world public opinion our previous appeals were unheard however we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the russian and armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins the committee for people s help to karabakh of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr everyone knows this even the turks know this you know this give us a time period when the world is currently boring and what is happening in armenia would make front page headlines think i m lying take a look at what happened in somalia when did the press report it to the world but perhaps turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the caucasus in the name of peace and democracy the armenians are christians the azerbaijanis are moslems and islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat westernizers besides at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on azerbaijan a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent azeri people hundreds of thousands of refugees and gross violations of human rights recently armenians attacked the azeri town of khojaly and massacred thousands of azeris the paris based association for democracy and human rights in azerbaijan puts the number of khojali victims at some of the dead were scalped and mutilated this whole thing has now gone entirely too far want to know what will bring the story in armenia to the front page if the russians move into the area with a shit load of tanks then your human rights advocates will show up defending the armenians of course we can also be sure that the russians won t show up with any tanks not with the problems they are having at home they already did the scenario and genocide staged by the armenians years ago in the ottoman empire is

talk.politics.mideast	the orders for the turkish extermination of the armenians the orders for the turkish extermination of the armenians to the children of genocide send them away into the desert this is part of a continuing series of articles containing official turkish wartime ww governmental telegrams in translation entailing the orders for the extermination of the armenian people in turkey generally these telegrams were issued by the turkish minister of the interior talaat pasha for example we have the following set regarding children to the government of aleppo november we are informed that the little ones belonging to the armenians from sivas mamuret ul aziz diarbekir and erzeroum hundreds of km distance from aleppo are adopted by certain moslem families and received as servants when they are left alone through the death of their parents we inform you that you are to collect all such children in your province and send them to the places of deportation and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to the people minister of the interior talaat to the government of aleppo september there is no need for an orphanage it is not the time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans prolonging their lives send them away to the desert and inform us minister of the interior talaat to the general committee for settling and deportees november there were more than four hundred children in the orphanage they will be added to the caravans and sent to their places of exile abdullahad nuri to the government of aleppo january we hear that certain orphanages which have been opened receive also the children of the armenians whether this is done through the ignorance of our real purpose or through contempt of it the government will regard the feeding of such children or any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it purpose since it considers the survival of these children as detrimental i recommend that such children shall not be received into the orphanages and no attempts are to be made to establish special orphanages for them minister of the interior talaat to the government of aleppo collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures to which their parents have been subjected send the rest away with the caravans minister of the interior talaat from the ministry of the interior to the government of aleppo at a time when there are thousands of moslem refugees and the widows of shekid fallen soldiers are in need of food and protection it is not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by armenians who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble in the future it is necessary that these children should be turned out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of deportation those that have been kept till now are also to be sent away in compliance with our previous orders to sivas minister of the interior talaat in halide edip a pioneer turkish nationalist wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with talaat pasha verifying and rationalizing this ultra national fascist anti armenian mentality the following i have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest and succeeds the world admires it and thinks it moral i am ready to die for what i have done and i know i shall die for it these telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the trial of talaat pasha s assassin soghomon tehlerian the turkish government never questioned these death march orders until during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the armenians for reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial the turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by s orel and s yuca of the turkish historical society if one were to examine the sample authentic text provided in the turkish historical society study and use their same forgery test on that sample it too would be a forgery in fact if any of the tests delineated by the turkish historical society are performed an any piece of ottoman turkish or persian arabic script one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery today the body of talaat pasha lies in a tomb on liberty hill istanbul turkey just next to the yildiz university campus the body of this genocide architect was returned to turkey from germany during ww when turkey was in a heightened state of proto fascism recently this monument has served as a focal point for anti armenianism in turkey this monument represents the epitome of the turkish government s pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people

azerbaijan really people in town didn t know what was happening on february i came home from school at o clock being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to baku when we left everything in town was fine life was the same as usual a few groups of people were discussing things soccer and other things then we got on the sumgait bus bound for baku for my first cousin s birthday my father my mother and i we spent the day in baku and on the th somewhere around p m we got on the bus for home figuring that i d have enough time to do my homework for the next day when we were entering town near the story high rises our bus was stopped by a very large crowd the crowd demanded that the armenians get off the bus the driver says that there are no armenians on board then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no armenians on board the group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one not checking passports just going by the way people look we get off the bus but are not taken for armenians we set out in the direction of home at first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there d be a place to hide but the whole road was packed with groups of people all the way from block to the th microdistrict these groups were emptying people s pockets and checking passports people who didn t have passports with them were beaten as well then we decided to go home instead near the story high rises i saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways yelling death to the armenians was written on the cars when we came into the courtyard we live in an l shaped building it was still quiet we went on upstairs but didn t turn on any lights we tried to call baku to warn our relatives who were due to arrive on wednesday not to come then there was a knock at the door it was our neighbors who advised us to come down to stay at their place we went down to their place and they led us to the basement they live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony we sat in the basement while an armenian woman was beaten she ran away naked our neighbors daughter said that that s right that s what the armenians deserve because in stepanakert allegedly people were being killed girls from agdam had been raped we didn t stay very long in the basement we tried to support one another as best we could looking out the small window with the iron grating papa watched and said things now and then he said that there was a fire near building probably a car on fire then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where armenians lived the neighbors said that there weren t any armenians here and the group set out for the other wing of the building they appeared from the side of the building where i later found out a woman had been murdered the woman who ran away naked died yuri avakian was killed too when the crowd left the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home we went back up to our place and again didn t turn on the light we started to gather up our things in order to leave sumgait for a while we tried to call a relative who lived in sumgait but there was no answer we decided she had already left we sat at home the phone rang and the caller asked to speak with my father i called him to the phone it was jeykhun mamedov from my father s work brigade he said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town he asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city to be quite honest papa didn t want to give him our address but my mother got on the phone and told him some minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway bursting into the building they broke down the door and came into the apartment they came straight to our apartment they knew exactly where the armenians were they came into our place we tried to resist but there was nothing we could do one of them took my parents passports and began to read them he read the surname danielian turned the page read armenian and that alone was enough to doom us he said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard where they would have done with us another standing next to him pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has tolled they had knives and steel truncheons i had a knife in my hand unfortunately i didn t use it i just knew that if i didn t give up the knife things would be much worse they struck my parents and said that i should put the knife on the piano then one of them commanded that we be taken outside one person was giving orders when we were taken outdoors i went in the middle and my mother was behind me someone started to push her so she d walk faster i let her go ahead of me and fell in behind her when he tried to push me i hit him and at that moment they began beating my parents i realized that resistance was completely useless we are taken out into the courtyard and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next the crowd surrounds us at first they strike me and i m knocked out when i come to they beat me again i lose consciousness often i don t see or hear my parents since i was the first one hit and was out cold when i come to i try to pick them up they are lying next to me the crowd is gone the only people around are watching from their balconies that s it i try to pick them up but can t my left arm is broken i start toward the drive wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance the bodies of my parents are still warm we were attacked at around o clock i regain consciousness at about and try to make it up the stairs home when i knock at the neighbors door they push me back and tell me to go away i go up to the third floor our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment i often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived but i can t see very far as a result of the blows and it seems that my parents have already been taken away then i calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away and everything will be ok but they were still there later at in the morning as i found out the ambulance picked them up but they were already dead if they received attention on time it is possible they would still be alive later around o clock on the th policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some assistants they call an ambulance and minutes later it arrives and i am taken to the sumgait emergency hospital there they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm at o clock i and the other armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to baku in my ward at the sumgait hospital there were five people all of them armenians the hospital was nearly overflowing with armenians the only azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events before the th then i was in the semashko hospital in baku i was there days when i was released on the th day i found out that my parents were dead at first they told me that they were in moscow being treated but later i found out that they were dead my father s older brother told me my father s name was nikolai artemovich danielian he was born in my mother born in was seda osipovna danielian papa worked at pmk the leader of the roofing brigade mamma was a compressor operator they were also beaten on the head the coroner s report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely at the confrontation i met jeykhun mamedov who had called as it turned out later he had been the one who tipped the crowd off he had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group he knew the phone number but didn t know the address before the events i had never seen him but had often spoken with him on the phone when he would ask to speak with my father i knew him by name he denies that i was the one who answered the phone saying that my father answered it he denies that he called from a public phone saying that he called from home which also isn t true i heard noise and the sounds of automobiles as i later found out earlier he had been convicted but had never served any time he had received a suspended sentence he was about years old i don t know if he has since confessed or not i am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off one hundred percent sure my parents were from karabagh father was from the village of badar and was two years old when his family moved to baku where his elder brothers were to go to school he was a student at the naval school but never graduated he went off to work on the virgin lands one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under khrushchev when he returned he lived in baku and later moved to sumgait helping with the town s construction mamma was from the village of dagdagan also from karabagh she worked in sumgait first in a bookstore and later on a construction site my sister is older than i she lives with her husband here in karabagh i always loved my parents that was why i went on to th grade because it was their dream that i would continue my studies i finished th grade and wanted to enter the baku nautical school and after that the military school but later i changed my mind or rather my parents got me to recon sider saying that it would be better to finish the th grade and then join the naval school i was planning to be in the navy almost my whole life long since childhood i had dreamed of being a sailor my father wanted it more than anything he always recollected his youth telling of the school and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it now i live in karabagh and never plan to leave here i will stay at the home of my grandfather of my ancestors till the end of my days while in the hospital in baku i learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well like ishkhan trdatov he managed to hold them off at their residence in microdistrict building apartment for a long time lost his father gabriel and by some miracle managed to survive i also learned of uncle sasha from building whose daughter was raped besides them valery i forgot his last name was in the hospital too about a year younger than i he went to school no he was riding with his parents in the car people were throwing rocks at them he was hit and his parents brought him to the hospital and he was in our ward we even came to be friends before that we had just seen each other around town but in the hospital we got to know one another better i learned of the fates of others those who had died or who were befallen by misfortune today suren harutunian the first secretary of the communist party of armenia was shown on television to be honest i am glad that armenia agreed to recognize nagorno karabagh as part of the armenian soviet socialist republic i was repelled no revolted to hear the baku announcer who read the decision of the azerbaijani supreme soviet presidium against karabagh becoming part of armenia after the events in sumgait and those in baku the best solution is to give karabagh to armenia return it to armenia since the people want to live peacefully with the azerbaijanis but everything has to be right before they can do that i arrived in karabagh on april i felt very bad i had constant headaches after a while my strength returned my older sister suzanna took me in i think that justice should prevail the people are demanding their due you can t take away what is their due my parents and i often spoke of nagorno karabagh often visited here spent almost all of my vacations here we had even decided that if karabagh would be made part of armenia we would move here for sure we always said that the armenian people had suffered much and that what had been done in removing nagorno karabagh from armenia was wrong sooner or later mistakes should be corrected and in order to correct a mistake it must not be repeated and the fate of all nagorno karabagh lies in the hands of our

talk.politics.mideast	re israelis murdered in march sorry guys for this long article but in fact it is mostly quotings in article flax apr frej teknikum uu se flax frej teknikum uu se jonas flygare writes when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate and hence all their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on the ground of occupied territories no i am not neglecting that i m merely asking you whether the existance of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right to live a as you so eloquently put it human right we can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later also you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights first my above statement doesnot say that the existence of israeli citizens in the wb revoke their right of life but it says the israeli occupation of the wb revoke the right of life for some most its citizens basically revokes the right of for its military men clearly occupation is an undeclared war during war attacks against military targets are fully legitimate ok let me re phrase the question i have repeatedly asked you if the israelis have less human rights than the palestinians well if you just waited for more lines you would have read my statement secondly surely israeli have human rights but and if so why because they belong to the human race or do you disagree on that too from your posting where you did not directly adress my question i inferred that you thought so together with the above statement i then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of israel re your statement of occupation i d like you to define the term so i don t have to repeat this drag the answer out of hasan procedure more than neccesary secondly surely israeli have human rights but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories not by further oppressing palestinean human rights i m sorry but the above sentence does not make sense please rephrase it i donot know about you but it makes full sense to me israelis are being killed because israel is occupying let israel withdraw and israeli blood will be saved it isnot the palestineans who undermined the right of life of israelis but it is israel which occupied and exposed the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of more generally the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada and i had previously posted a long article about this issue whom i finished by an open question suppose the intifada stops what is the motive for israel to withdraw donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit everybody in the world looks and hopes for peace so why isnot there any hope of peace is necessary but not sufficient motive if a state can deprive all it s citizens of human rights by its actions then tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all because not all states are like israel as oppressive as ignorant or as tyrant oh ok so how about the human rights of the syrians iraqis and others does the name of hama sound familiar or how about the kurds in iraq and turkey how about the same in sweden ok maybe a bit farfetched the russians in the baltic states or the moslem in the old ussr and yugoslavia do the serbs have any human rights remainaing according to you as for the arabian countries their problems are an arabian concern the arabian people can deal with it themselves if the west doesnot intervene as for serbs i donot think that those fucked up rapists excuse my language but it really hurts as much if i was in bosnia itself arenot humans those surely came from outer space or something no human can allow himself to see such attrocities than to participate in and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem the question is not which system would solve the me problem why because any system can solve it the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here all palestine i asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for all people involved i assumed that was obvious but i won t repeat that mistake now that i have straightened that out i m eagerly awaiting your reply so you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph no i m agreeing that to just kick all the palestinians out of israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both parties if that s what you refer to as the israeli solution then so be it ok joseph weitz administrator responsible for jewish colonization said it best when writing in his diary in between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country the only solution is a palestine at least western palestine west of the jordan river without arabs and there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to transfer all of them not one village not

must be just because otherwise it would never be lasting however when politicians say a solution they donot mean a just solution but just a solution the greatest problem of zionism is arab children

to be unrepentant though embarrassed and still possessed of the same fucked up hubris laden self righteousness that the theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal nazi armenians of the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle now try dealing with the rest of what i wrote what is more the activities of the armenian government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race the turks or aimed at carrying out a one sided feud instead of being a struggle for liberation from the outset the efforts of the armenian revolutionaries within the ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder cruelty and genocide so that no other interpretation of them is possible armenian activities started during the reign of abdulhamid ii as individual acts of terror and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks the element of brute force in these activities increased steadily culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the first world war furthermore when the ottoman army withdrew from eastern anatolia after the sarikamis defeat armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area although the russians occupied eastern anatolia as an enemy nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war however when they returned to their country in after the revolution armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the ottoman forces returned to erzurum in during this period armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents for example let us look at a report dated march which the commander of the third army submitted when he entered erzurum and erzincan they were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by armenians even the trees were cut down and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word as for the people who had been living in erzurum and erzincan those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of sarikamis and annihilated when the russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in armenian massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act a very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to including women and children such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirty thousand in erzurum all the fields in erzincan and erzurum are untilled everything that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them in a destitute situation at the present time the people are subsisting on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area foreign observers who witnessed the events including russian officers who did not desert their lines submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war what is most important is that they stated in their reports the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned at the end of the war the german author dr weiss his austrian colleague dr stein and his turkish colleague mr ahmet vefik visited trabzon kars erzurum and batum between april th and may th to record the cruelties their writings not only show the

talk.politics.mideast	re no humanity in bosnia it is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting i recieved a couple of letters too some has debated the statement that events in bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world those who contest this statement present the figures of the world war ii however we must keep in mind that it was a world war and no country had the power to stop it today is the matter not of the power but of the will it seems to be that what we lack is the will second point of difference which makes it different from the holocast sp is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event today inspite of all the might the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully hence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally mankind has sided with the killers and this i think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world m rizvi

construction and installation administration secretary of the smu komsomol organization resident at building b apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan on the th my sister marina and i went to the movies the seven o clock show at the theater that is across from the city party committee about yards away the sk theater they were showing an argentinian film the abyss before the film we noticed about to people standing near the podium at the city party committee but they were silent there s no conversation whatsoever and we couldn t figure out what was going on that is we knew it was about karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we didn t know we bought our tickets there were or people in the theater this was a very small number for that large movie theater the film started about minutes later they stopped the film a crowd burst in about people they came up onto the stage well mostly they were young people from to years old they demanded that an armenian woman come up onto the stage they used foul language and said that they were going to show what azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to armenian girls i thought that s what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically marina and i were sitting together i told her to move over there were some russian girls sitting nearby so that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not marina it got quiet or girls jumped up to run out but the door was closed it s only opened at the end of the show and they returned to their seats everyone in the theater was looking at one another russians azerbaijanis people of various nationalities but no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a sound they were silent looking at one another and gradually started to leave some guy a really fat one says ok we ve scared them enough let s leave they leave slowly pompously it seemed to me that those people were not themselves either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone apart then it was all over as though nothing had happened at all the film started up again it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive we could barely sit to the end so it had started at seven it was over by nine and it was dark marina and i were walking home lenin street that s the center of town lenin street was packed just packed with young people they were shouting something about karabagh and something about armenians we weren t especially listening because the way we were feeling we didn t know if we were going to make it home or not and just what had happened anyway public transportation wasn t running incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police policemen standing there the director of the movie theater was looking at the doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all glass everything was broken he stood there grief stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot well since he looked more or less calm i decided that nothing all that super serious had happened we went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop away we didn t want to go on foot not because it was dark but because something might happen we flagged down a cab but the driver didn t want to take us we told him we live near the bus station and he said he d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther i said well ok so we got into the cab and managed to get there something incredible was happening at the bus station there was a traffic jam public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ka ra bagh they re not going to give up karabagh i go home and tell my family what s going on and there s immediate panic in the house mamma says what should we do like the end had come they were going to come kill us that s it somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up nothing that bad could happen where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have somehow we manage to calm mamma down and we went to bed but no one could sleep everyone made as though nothing had happened that was on saturday in short the day went by we didn t go anywhere and didn t call our relatives no one did anything because life goes on that day i realized something was approaching but what exactly i couldn t guess on the th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always had there were five of us at home mamma papa and us three sisters lyuda marina and i my sister lyuda was in yerevan at the time we sat at home and no one went out later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning it all started they were smashing up stores we were sitting at home and didn t know anything about it then a girlfriend of mine lyuda zimogliad came by at around three o clock i think we worked together we did our apprenticeships together she s a russian girl she said that something awful was happening in town i asked don t they want armenians well what are they after if they re already in that state she says no nothing like that it s just a demonstration but it s awful to watch it somehow it feels like a war has broken out public transportation has been stopped the cabs the buses well it s just a nightmare then papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time he left the house and our neighbor aunt vera asked him where are you going stop there are such terrible things going on in the courtyard aren t you afraid to go out papa didn t know what she was talking about she simply pushed him back into the entryway he came home and told mamma mamma said well if aunt vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on but we didn t go see her she s a russian she lives across from us i had to see my friend out around five o clock i tell lyuda ok look it s time for you to go it s late already i ll see you out mamma says you don t need to go it s too late already you can see what the situation in town is so we decided to stay home dinner was ready mamma says let her eat with us then she can go we sat down at the table but no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we re eating we turned on the television and the show in fairy tale land was coming on we cleared the table we hear some noise out in the courtyard i go out on the balcony but i can t see what s going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station and there is a story building in the way there is mob of people i can t figure out what s happening they re shouting something looking somewhere i can t make out what is going on i go down to a neighbor she s an azerbaijani we ve been friends of her family for about years i go down to look from their place i see people shouting looking at the and story buildings near the bus station just then soldiers set upon them about people with clubs the mob runs off in different directions i even see several people from our building they are looking and laughing i decide that means it s not all that bad if they are laughing it means they re not killing anyone but now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers one of the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyone s kicking him i become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there can t speak well they ve probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is if each of them kicked him just once they took his club away from him and started to beat him with it but it was far away and i couldn t see if he got up and left or not i become terrified and go home and say lyuda don t go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the story building and starts shouting something we go out onto the balcony all of our neighbors are also out on theirs too everyone is standing staring the mob is shouting and about minutes later comes running toward our building as it turns out at the story building the azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in there s only one entryway there they could stop them they all run up to our building mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw stones they have stones and they break the windows all of them there are very many people we have a large courtyard and it s packed with people they spill up to the first floor so they don t crush each other they crawl up on trees posts and garages it s just a huge cloud of people they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey sargisian from our building we close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar it s incomprehensible mamma told me later that they were shouting father s name grisha open the door we ve come to kill you or something like that i don t remember that i was spaced out kind of mamma says into the bedroom quickly in the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry mamma says hide there they probably won t come in there they ll ask something say something and leave she says we ll tell them that we live alone here i can t imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts i go to them and say that i ll stand together with them i ll talk with them if they come maybe i can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me i speak azerbaijani more or less and i can find out what they want i told marina and lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister lyuda i can t remember if i told her anything or not then they open the door it s like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall the crows bursts in and starts to shout get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia things like that i tell them what has happened speak calmly one of you tell me calmly what has happened in azerbaijani they say get out of the apartment leave i say ok go downstairs we ll gather everything we need and leave the apartment i realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them these are animals they must be stopped the ones standing in the doorway the young guys say there are old people and one girl with them too bad they take two or three steps back it seems as though i have pacified them with our exchange then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them don t you understand what you are saying kill them and that was it that was all it took they grab papa carry him into one room and mamma and me into another they put mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs they start tearing my clothes right there in front of mamma i don t remember where they went what they did or how much time passed i had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time i don t even know what i said the atrocities started i was savagely raped in that room they argued among themselves who would go first later i remember i came to i don t know if i m dead or alive someone comes in someone tall i think clean shaven in an eskimo dogskin coat balding he looks around at what s happening at that instant everything stops it seems to me that he is either their commander or that somehow everything depends on him he looks and says well we re done here they are beating mamma on the head they break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs she loses consciousness and they decide that she s dead papa was out cold they want to throw lyuda off the balcony but they can t get the window open apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can t be opened they leave her next to the window she was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out she s not a real strong person anyway he looks at me and sees that i m saying something that i m still twitching well i start saying the opposite of what i should be which is humbling myself and pleading i start shouting cursing they don t get any entreaty out of me i already know that i m dead why would i humble myself before anyone and he says that if that s what i think since my tongue is so long maybe he thinks that i still look quite appealing in short he commands that i be taken outside i no longer saw or remembered what was happening to marina and lyuda i don t know if they are alive or not they take me outside they are dragging me by my arms by my legs they are hitting me against the wall the railings something metal while they are carrying me someone is biting me someone else is pinching me i don t even know i think my god when will death come if only it were sooner then they carry me out throw me near the entryway and start kicking me i lose consciousness what happened after that how many people there were i don t remember i come to after a while i don t remember how long a neighbor is bringing me clothing i m entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me i remember that i said the same words over and over again mamma what happened mamma what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at i can t make sense out of anything there is a guy standing over me i sort of know him he served in afghanistan his name is igor he brought me indoors when they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there igor gathered his courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors even though he s small minded he put himself at risk igor agayev is azerbaijani he served in afghanistan there are three brothers the older brother also served there i think now he s stationed here on the border in armenia igor brought me to the neighbors and then helped me come to my senses saying karina i know you calm down i m not one of them how do i know who s who and what s what i come to and they clean me up i was covered in blood then papa i saw papa i saw mamma and marina too igor was there when they dragged marina and lyuda out from under the bed marina lyuda said that she was russian they said we ll let you go we aren t touching the russians go and while they are dragging marina out she decides she s going to tell them she s azerbaijani igor immediately grabs marina s and lyuda s hands because he knows marina and knows that she is armenian and is our sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor s and starts pounding on the door so she will open up she opens the door and igor pushes them in there so they survived my sister lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things while they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back up again lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor s on the fourth floor the one whose apartment i had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and knocked on the door the neighbor opened and said i m not going to let you in the apartment because i m afraid of them but i ll give you some stockings and we ll leave the building lyuda says i ll stay at your place because of what s going on they keep going up and down the stairs it was just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor wouldn t consent lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed i came to mother was there i can t remember my supervisor s telephone number but something had to be done somehow i remembered and called and he came to get us he didn t have any idea what was going on he thought we were simply afraid he didn t know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death he came and got us and took us to the police precinct there they looked us over i was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly it was hard to breathe my supervisor s name is urshan feyruzovich mamedov he s the head of our administration they took us there when we were leaving i saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town the buses were ordinary passenger buses there were very many soldiers we left around eleven right after eleven if these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives because the crowd was moving on toward the school and what was going on there i think everyone know not only in sumgait not only in yerevan because there they murdered them all one after the next without stopping after us i think people died in microdistrict no and to of them were from buildings and in our building one person died and one old woman died from building that s the building in front of ours there young azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn t let it into their building incidentally when we were at the neighbors marina called our relatives to warn them so they would all know what was happening i called a aunt in microdistrict no they have three neighbors who are armenians i said run quickly i can t explain what s going on hide do what you can just stay alive hide at azerbaijanis ones who won t give you away at that moment three people came in policemen i think they were azerbaijanis i was in such awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought i would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead was badly cut and one half of my face was pushed out forward no one would have thought that i would survive get my normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all i started to scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you here haven t you killed people people yet what are you doing here one of the soldiers said don t scream at us we re muslims but we re not from the sumgait police they called in from daghestan so at that point the daghestan police were there when we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen i don t know maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct i don t know what they were there for there were also doctors from baku there they examined lyuda and me and said these women need to go to the maternity home but we don t know what to do with the rest so they took us and i lost contact with my parents my boss everyone my boss said don t worry i ll find you no matter where you are no matter what happens we went to the hospital there we were examined by a department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva i think her name was she examined us the ambulance was from baku i figured out that the sumgait ambulances hadn t done anything they didn t respond to any calls people called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life that doctor looked me over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened for she became quite glad i even thought to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong she looks me over and says now why are you suffering so you don t know what your people have been doing your people did even worse things and i think great i have to deal with her and i felt so bad i thought why don t i just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her here i am in this condition and being told about something that our people did i just didn t have the energy to say how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven t already done i stayed there then they brought in another woman ira b she was married and she was raped in her own apartment too there were three of us ira lyuda and the next morning they took lyuda and ira away they didn t do anything to help us this was in the old maternity home in the combined block they didn t do anything more than examine me that was it i didn t want any shots or tranquilizer nothing what shots could have calmed me down i didn t even want to look at them i lay in the ward either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur pose but i was alone i was alone even though the wards were packed that same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face was disfigured she asked what had happened to me and i said better to ask your brother what happened there s no point in asking me your brother can better explain what happened she fell into a faint all the doctors threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me clothing because i was literally naked the only thing i had on was a dress but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up above my knees and the woman orderly said i can t believe you put on such a short dress who are you showing off your legs to here i went back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something people from work came and brought me something in a sack apples i think three or four pounds but i couldn t take them i had become so weak that it was just embarrassing i said that i couldn t take the apples and really didn t have any appetite no one had to bring me anything some woman took the sack and oh yes then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i was an armenian maybe they wouldn t figure it out from looking at me so they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be worse or perhaps someone was outside on the street i don t know in any case i didn t sleep a wink that night the next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we went i didn t even know where they were taking me they took me to the club where the troops were the very one i was in that ill fated evening i got off the bus near the city party committee there were a great many troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible i saw a few people i knew there and that calmed me a little i had already thought that i was the only one left so there were five or six of us left in sumgait after that night i still didn t know what happened to my parents they didn t come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine i didn t know whether to believe him or not maybe he was just trying to calm me down maybe something happened on the way then i went to the club and saw a lot of people i knew they all knew one another they were all kissing each other and asking what happened what went on two days later they came to see me from work they were there all the time each day they came showed interest and were constantly bringing me money they did everything they could of course i m most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues who didn t lose his presence of mind and who didn t change his opinions neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happened he constantly took an interest a sincere interest from the heart then about two days later the secretary of the party committee came not from our party organization but from the first trust which ours is part of comrade kerimov a very important figure in our town he made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if i sat down by myself i couldn t get up or lie down again there was something wrong with my lungs it was hard to breathe they examined me there several times there i lay were several doctors they all thought that that it must just be from all the blows i don t know they didn t diagnose anything in particular when i was in the maternity home i even asked i made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful there was no way something inside wasn t broken my ribs well they took me there and took x rays and said that everything was fine there were emergency medical workers on duty in the club the mother of one of marina s friends was there she was the head doctor at the sumgait children s clinic they had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what i needed at that moment i thought i said that i was having great difficulty breathing i couldn t seem to get enough air something was wrong with me they put tight bandages around my chest and waist later i overheard some people saying that i had been cut all over i think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut but i wasn t cut they took us to the khimik boarding house we lived there a long time soon appeared representatives they were agitating at first people would not talk to them and drove them off one of the armenian women shouted we demand that seidov come the response was it s seidov who sent us seidov is the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers the woman said we ll only see seidov s daughter have her come here we ll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters and then we ll deal with you agitators and so on more of them said have seidov himself come this went on day in day out the agitators kept coming and coming this drove us out of our wits then people gradually started departing for yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay everything got on our nerves the smell the small children there were children at the sk club children who had literally just come out of the maternity home what were they doing in a club that didn t even have running water all the time at first we had to pay to eat there they even overcharged us as it turned out on the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free the children were ill everything stank there well imagine about people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than you couldn t sit or lie down it was impossible to even move the stench was awful even the smallest infants took ill overnight there i heard that they were arriving seriously ill in yerevan the infants they have to be washed they have to be bathed not to mention that we the adults were ill and needed care people were fainting right and left i just don t know everyone was crying everyone only the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together but the women were in a constant state of panic it seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn t be a single armenian left then people went up to the attic i didn t see them i only heard them because i was lying down and couldn t get up i lay right on the stage we had some room there apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas i think they wanted to burn the theater maybe someone saw them i didn t i was in no condition to open my eyes everyone was suspicious of everyone else they would ask aren t you an azerbaijani i think i saw you somewhere i think you re an azerbaijani they led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports relatives might be covering for each other half of the people did not have any documents there were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like they should have with their ids so on the th on sunday i think the police did nothing to help us on monday everything resumed where it had left off on block a they didn t spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody they killed they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible they murdered the melkumian family whom i knew my mother worked with them their daughter in law went to school with my older sister they were brutally murdered only the two daughters in law survived by a miracle one was able to save herself she ran away the neighbors wouldn t take her in so she ran about the building until she found refuge she was pregnant and had two small children this all continued on monday in block a on the th when the troops were already in the city they murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire families they say they didn t even know for sure if the people were armenians or not i heard that the lezgins suffered too i m not sure myself i didn t see any lezgins who had been injured they burned cars so it s very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn t it was very difficult to identify the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned it s all very hard to imagine of course i heard that many people disappeared without a trace from the btz plant two people including a woman who worked the night shift aunt razmella who also lived in microdistrict they were stopping buses between baku and sumgait in the evening people who had been visiting baku were returning to sumgait and people from baku were going home from sumgait and there were students too they were simply savagely murdered they were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people they stopped the buses dragged the armenians out and killed them on the spot i didn t see it myself but i heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them later it was hard to discern from the corpses well you can t call them corpses you had to figure out from the ashes who it was l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student ira g if i m not mistaken she was in the hospital a long time after that and she still can t figure out who saved her she was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses the fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and carried her to the city i still can t imagine how he managed to do that i heard that from engels grigorian he knows her apparently well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway she was in the hospital and singing a song in armenian and they wrote the words down and i think he still has that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape they couldn t find the guy who saved her he left her in someone s apartment and called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me she couldn t remember anyone s face i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe i had talked with him once but i received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head i can t remember to this day who he was then it seems i saw the secretary of the directorate s party organization where marina works she goes to school and works she goes to night school at azi and works by day at the khimzashchita construction and installation administration i m the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of party and komsomol organizations we had joint meetings i know them all i ve even talked with them and he i know is from armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it became obvious that many of those people were azerbaijanis born in armenia they took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy got involved in the case and i iden tified the photographs of people who i could more or less recognize they showed me the people who were in our apartment they re working on our case but i can t even recognize them although it was proved that they were the ones they re processing it somehow they tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me there was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that all these people all of them as much as i ve heard about them and seen them they were all from kafan the secretary of the party organization is named najaf najaf rzayev he was there when everything started it must have been him because i didn t recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him all the more since i told him listen you do something because you know me he turned away and went toward the bedroom where marina was well you couldn t see marina anyway there was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn t make out anyone all of it flew right out of my head and then gradually i became myself again at the city party committee there were military people there i told them what went on and they wrote it all down i told them his name on march the secretary of our first trust party organization the one we re part of came to see us his name is najaf rzayev i tell mamma if he s here despite the fact that i gave his name it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think i m crazy not responsible for my words he said what did they do to you how awful myself i hid an armenian family then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different i wasn t at home my family and i went to baku i said marina what is he saying he said something totally different before after that i didn t go to see our procurator our case is being handled by a procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov told me that rzayev s case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved what are they doing with rzayev did he prove his alibi or not they just think that since i was hit in the head i can t say anything for sure whether it was him or not it will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn t have to pay for it but at the same time i m afraid to say i m a hundred percent sure that it was he because no mat ter who i name they tell me no you re wrong he didn t do that that one wasn t there all the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind who did what exactly i can t say when they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but i didn t see it because i had my eyes closed all the time it seemed to me that i always got it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible when they were beating my face i thought they were trying to put my eyes out so i had my eyes closed they took me outside and started to beat me a young guy held my arms he works at the btz plant and right nearby across the road from us block is where all this was going on right across the road from us the btz dormitory is over there that s where he lives now he s in custody they even have proved as far as i know that it was he who killed shurik gambarian the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building one person in our building was killed it was that man a guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me he saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he didn t come over he just looked and then went into the dormitory a while after it was all over people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned that guy went and told them everything now they ve caught him everything s been proved now evidently they ve been beating him i don t know what they re doing with them over there but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant some young guy came to the plant and said everyone who wants to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten that was it he said the ones who wanted to went this was at the btz plant during the night shift probably late friday night it was at night they were at the sauna together and he said what do you mean do you understand what you are saying the others were silent probably in their hearts they were thinking i m going to go but they didn t say anything to one another he said that he thought it important to to go because he had heard a lot about what had happened in kafan that they had killed their azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of that that guy was also born in kafan that is certain and marina says that the secretary of the party organization is from armenia too from i ve participated in the investigation a couple of times i m satisfied with them thus far they summoned us and asked about what happened and every word i said was recorded i met some guy there by the way he was an armenian i said that he was in our apartment but what he did i don t know his last name was grigorian eduard grigorian he s from sumgait from microdistrict he was sentenced i think to five years not his first time his mother is russian i met with him at the kgb in baku at the azerbaijani kgb they took us there and showed me photographs there were so many photographs i think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew and i ve got them all confused i say the face was about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasps but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack well this guy grigorian i said he was in our apartment but he is so light complected that he looks like a lezgin i don t know what he did i can t remember maybe he beat me or raped me but he was in our apartment at the kgb he started asking me pleading with me there s no need for this all this stuff look me in the eyes you re like a sister to me i took a look at him and thought my god heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you but they were satisfied with my responses because i said everything without great certainty i was there with mamma then lyuda came in but when she came in she got sick immediately she wanted to kill him she crawled over the table at him she recognized him when she came to lyuda was lying on the balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom we had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters they stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things at that moment lyuda came to and started remembering everything well seeing the faces hearing the voices two people were saying they could burn the apartment another says why burn the apartment when i ve got three kids and no place to live so this guy was in temporary housing he didn t have anywhere to live he was from sumgait they were sure that they would get the apartment besides the neighbors were azerbaijani why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijanis that s what they said how did they know there were azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that armenians lived there we have a list of the residents for our part of the building our name is in there but how could they know that azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us so they didn t set fire to our apartment i don t know i was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when i was outside if someone had asked me what was happening i would have said that a civil war was going on well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they were beating me i opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at a free horror film so a civil war was going on and only the armenians were being fought if it were a world war or something like that they would have been fighting everyone but they only fought us then i met some women from our building some azerbaijanis they are crying they tell me karina we saw all of it how could it happen they re asking me well i just don t know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me i think that if it were the other way around either i wouldn t have been able to take it or i would have tried to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman did in front of our building a woman lives there an awful dissipated woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads two armenian families live there in her part of the building she came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse she came down to the entryway and said you ll come in this entryway over my dead body so not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn t even know what they were doing i don t think that s true they knew very well what they were doing if they didn t even lift a hand against that woman they couldn t have cared less about her but the fact that she was an azerbaijani stopped them they were just beasts they had smoked so much when they came to our place they were all chewing something i noticed everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something i think my god maybe i just think that maybe i m losing my mind but no they re all chewing something maybe it is some kind of drug it must be because at first glance they all seemed to be such normal people young clean shaven looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration but they were shouting something they didn t talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there they screamed and screamed yeah killing killing we re killing the armenians only they didn t shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary gurun literally means kill or destroy that s how it was i ll continue we hid in a captain s apartment he s an azerbaijani his wife is a tatar we were sitting in their apartment their kids were out in the yard their kids knew a whole lot this was in our part of the building on the third floor when mamma came to and couldn t find lyuda she took papa s hand this was while the looters were stealing things but they didn t pay attention because they were stealing things apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing mamma found the courage to a boy said to my mother where s the gold mamma said he must have been to years old he even looked russian he was so fair skinned but the azerbaijanis from armenia are fair skinned i noticed they were all on the fair side he shouted they were all smashing things and he asks mamma where the gold is we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers in a little black bag we kept everything in there mamma doesn t really like to wear gold she probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her they took everything that was lying on the cheval glass mamma thinks that the gold saved us because they threw themselves at the gold and mamma grabbed papa who was trying to breathe they had closed his mouth bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face they had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off he had something in his mouth he was having trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them mamma said that by accident completely by accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said half awake what s happened he sees that they are bloody mamma said at least go and find out what s happening to my daughters even if they ve burned them or murdered them at least bring the corpses he went looking for us at that moment lyuda was under the bed she says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name when he quietly called her she couldn t get out from under the bed she wanted to get out and was calling softly she thought she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting when she got out from under the bed everyone was gone and again she thought that she had lost her mind i ll never leave here never to hell with it it just seems that way to me i ll come to eventually but then when everything had settled down stopped that mall brought lyuda down and igor carried me in from outside or first i was brought in then lyuda i don t remember what order it happened in and mamma said listen they re all running around down there shouting something or other and running toward the other building it had more or less calmed down where we were who s dead who s alive we don t know i tried to call my girlfriend i had basically come to mamma says listen let s go upstairs at least get a mattress or something we don t know how long we ll be here maybe they didn t burn everything i don t get it all women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe not everything was taken i tell mamma mamma what do you need any of that for to hell with it we re alive forget the rest of it all of it she says no let s go get at least something maybe we ll leave here spend the night at someone else s mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son alik was standing on the lookout lie was standing there to see if they were coming they only managed to run up there and grab something one time he shouts come back they re coming they didn t have enough time to get a lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another mamma got my knitting someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore out of the hall someone took father s old coveralls the neighbor his wife mamma and papa marina went with them i was in no condition to leave neither was lyuda we just sat they ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs they re dragging something again they were going toward the other building maybe over by the school or there was an unfinished building over there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building they could gradually carry everything over there then things more or less calmed down i tried to call my boss later there was more noise we were on the third floor in a one bedroom apartment and a woman lives in the one bedroom place on the second floor asya dallakian she s an old woman retired she wasn t at home at that time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and her grandson is in the army she is only very rarely in town she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant they started pounding on her door and broke it down she had two or three beds in there something like that she s a to year old woman who really does not even live there probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses and a television when her grandson came she bought a television they started wrecking everything i started getting sick again i think my god what is going on around here when will this end we turned off the lights and sat as it turns out the people who weren t afraid the ones who knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights we didn t know but they didn t come to where we were all the same they all knew very well that he was a captain he went out and closed the door and we sat in his apartment his last name was kasumov he s an exserviceman retired works up at the fire station at some plant or other he went out and stood at his door they tell him comrade captain don t worry we won t harm you you re one of us he went upstairs and they say aren t you taking anything from this apartment he says i don t need anything and the women who were standing in the yard we have a basement full of water the women who were standing in the yard saw those guys they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again the women threw everything they had time to into the basement to save our property some things were left dirty pillows two or three other things and a rug a guy came downstairs really mad and he says where s the rug i just put it right here they tell him some guy came and took it and went off toward the school he ran off in that direction oh i forgot the most important point when igor picked me up in his arms there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on they just didn t tell me about it for a long time the wife of that military man she didn t want to kill my spirit i was already dead enough later she told me that after they murdered uncle shurik in the third entryway one of them the ringleader apparently a young man said where s the girl who was here and he became furious the woman tells him she came to she didn t know what to say think something up someone carried her off then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family so the woman says she came to and went to the basement now our basement is full of water so the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse they took flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been standing there for years and soot and fuel oil they climbed down in there to get me then one of them said there s so much water down there she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died she met her death in the basement that s it we can leave no problem i didn t know that and when i was told i felt worse two times worse a lot worse so they didn t just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me after that we of course didn t want to live in sumgait any longer we really didn t want to go back to our apartment when we moved i went up there and started to quiver and shake all over because i started remembering it all although the neighbors all sobbed it was all so cheap the people who sat in their apartments and didn t help us at a time like that i think that they could have helped i don t think that they were obligated to but they could have helped us because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself that means they could have too it would have been enough foe one man or women to say what do you think you re doing that s all that would have done it there were apartments in our building not one person said it when i was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies i didn t hear anyone s voice no one said what are you doing leave her alone mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one armenian they would have stood up for one of their own true they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway an old sick woman tried to stop the pogrom the azerbaijanis have a custom if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed to stop immediately the old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said if you want to go on living you ll disappear into your apartment so she left that trick didn t work on them even the neighbors who helped us move told me ok fine calm down forget that it happened i said i d only forget it if i told them right then that it had happened to their daughter and if that didn t have any effect on them then i would forget everything too imagine that it happened to your sister and no one did anything anything april yerevan reference the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan volume i

who is representing the plaintiffs the adl s information gathering network was revealed publicly last week when the san francisco district attorney s office released documents indicating the group had spied on people and political and ethnic groups for more than years my understanding is that they the adl consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to israel or israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate said arens a research scientist at the university of southern california the adl believes that anyone who is arab american or speaks politically against israel is at least a closet anti semite the fbi and the district attorney s office have been investigating the operation for four months the plaintiffs in the case include arens the son of former israeli defense

talk.politics.mideast	pr campaign against iran pbs frontline there have been a number of articles on the pbs frontline program about iranian bomb here is my on this and related subjects one is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about iran in recent months these include attempts to implicate iran in the bombing of the new york trade center despite great efforts in this direction they have not succeeded in this they however have indirectly created the impression that iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter public statements by the secretary of state christoffer and other official sources regarding iran being a terrorist and outlaw state and finally the recent broadcast of the frontline program i suspect that this pr campaign against iran will continue and perhaps intensify why this increased pressure on iran a number of factors may have been behind this these include the rise of islamic movements in north africa and radical hamas movement in the israeli occupied territories this movement is basically anti western and is not necessarily fueled by iran the cause for accelerated pace of this movement is probably the gulf war which sought to return colonial shieks and amirs to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom also the obvious support of algerian military coup against the democratically elected algerian islamic front which clearly exposed the democracy myth a further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of bosnian moslems possible future implications of this movement in saudi arabia and other us client states and endangerment of the cheap oil sources from this region a need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense expenditures this has become necessary after the demise of soveit union the recent pr campaign against iran however seems to be directed from israel rather than washington there is no fundamental conflict of interest between iran and the us and in my opinion it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations this may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the islamic world and iran jamshid

february journalist guy ehrlich subject interview with soldiers who served in the duvdevan cherry units which disguise themselves as arabs and operate within the occupied territories excerpts from the article a lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods but the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with it is that everyone who serves in the cherry after a time goes in one way or another insane gee i d better tell this to the mental health branch of the israeli army medical corps where would we be without you davidson a man who said this who will here be called danny his full name is known to the editors served in the cherry after his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy his pal who will here be called dudu was also serving in the cherry and is now about to depart for a round the world tour they both look no different from average israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service but in their souls one can notice something completely different it was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them and they think that to most of their fellows from the cherry it woundn t be easy either yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking the following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry we called such soldiers h i hit by the intifada under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non stop which is a common phenomenon in the cherry i sent him to a psychiatrist but why i should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane on fridays when i come home my parents know i cannot be talked to until i go to the beach surf a little calm down and return the keys of my father s car must be ready for in advance so that i can go there i they dare talk to me before or whenever i don t want them to talk to me i just grab a chair and smash it instantly i know it is my nerve smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home to the car and to the beach only there i become normal another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother it was an omelette of sorts she took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me i then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind i told her how i shot an arab and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it she began to laugh hysterically i wanted her to cry and she dared laugh straight in my face instead so i told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov cocktails he shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as they deserved one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire with the effect that the arab was burning all over just beautifully i was delighted to see it my pal fired three bullets two at the arab with the molotov cocktail and the third at his chum it hit him straight in his ass we both felt that we d pulled off something next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look i reached the spot first and then that arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at me i yelled shut up and he dared talk back to me in hebrew so i just laughed straight in his face i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes then i told him all right wait a moment i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that i keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my face this infuriated me i got very angry because i felt i was becoming mad so i stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her head only then she stopped laughing at first she didn t know what to say but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field a gull appeared right in the middle of the field my friend shot it at once then we noticed four deer standing high up on the sigh four deer in tel aviv well this is probably as accurate as the rest of this fantasy hill above us my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock we shot down two deer more and went to take a look when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother we carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit we were just delighted by that sight we had hit em so good then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further suffering i approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of prey we couldn t explain what had happened to us we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly we always go back to places we carried out assignments in this is why we can see them when you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you got power you feel godlike of sorts both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting dudu is not willing to work in any security linked occupation danny feels the exact opposite why shouldn t i take advantage of the skills i have mastered so well why shouldn t i earn for each chopped head i would deliver while being a mercenary in south africa this kind of job suits me

parties including the ruling pasok party and a host of political groups both armenian and non armenian joined to voice their solidarity with the armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new armenian political force were voiced here on sunday april during the nd international meeting of solidarity with the armenian people and judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations at least here in greece the armenian cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world the international meeting of solidarity was sponsored by the greek branch of the armenian popular movement a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of armenians who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia asala the organization has branches in various european and middle eastern countries and the united states although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of asala voicing the support of pasok the ruling party in greece to the armenian people was mr charalambidi michalis a member of the central committee of the party and the greek member of the permanent people s tribunal explaining the goals and aspirations of the armenian popular movement was ara sarkisian significant was the address delivered by mr bassam abu salim on behalf of the popular front for the movement s continued support of the armenians armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause pledging that palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to armenian youth who need training for such a struggle later mr abu salim answering a question put to him by this writer affirmed that his organization had always trained armenian members of asala and that this policy will continue the doors of our camps are always open to armenian freedom fighters he affirmed among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of prime minister papandreou who himself holds a post in the greek cabinet two members of the cypriot parliament who had journeyed to athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering representatives of the christian democratic party edik center party two wings of the communist party representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations a number of mayors of greek towns and cities two greek members of the european parliament and other members of the greek parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of bulgaria in athens more than significant was the large number of messages received by the organizers including the following palestinian national revolutionary movement fatah popular front for the liberation of palestine general command the central committee of the palestinian national liberation movement fatah the socialist progressive party of lebanon arab socialist labor party the kurdistan democratic union of iraq and numerous other international groups all noted for their radical stand in the israeli palestinian conflict support from arf rm among messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary federation revolutionary movement the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers the message clearly gave its support to the armenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement will continue to reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are to expose the anti armenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag bureau the message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be that exists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement open supporters of asala and armed struggle the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the greek capital known as neos kosmos where there is a large armenian presence the headquarters are located in a two story building which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of armenian youth who prefer to give their first names only when invited

claimed mr davidian it has pages any question well it seems your book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the n crap posted by mr o boy please can you tell us why those quotes are crap because you do not like them because they really exist why as i said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by serdar argic you couldn t reject it in addition the author s preface was written on january but the book was published in here we go again in the book i have both the front page and the author s preface give the same year and january respectively anyone can check it at her his library if not i can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct i really don t care what year it was first published or what i care about is what the book writes about murders tortures et in the given quotes by serdar argic and your denial of these quotes and your groundless accussations etc dd i can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim vd what is new i will post a gif file but i am not going go through the effort to show there is some turkish modified re publication of the book like last time i claim i have a book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in serdar argic s reference has you couldn t reject it but now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around let s see how you lie from non existing quotes to re publication first you said there was no such a quote in the given reference you called serdar argic a liar i said to you no mr davidian there exactly existed such a quote i even gave the call number page numbers you could t reject it and now you are lying again and talking about modified re published book without any proof how when where by whom etc by the way how is it possible to re publish the book in if it was first published in your claim i am sure that you have some pretty well suited theories as usual and i am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and mr davidian s lies i also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use which are r and the page numbers to verify the quotes and it is not possible that s text has pages mine has and yours has now are you claiming that there can t be such a reference by saying it is not possible if not what is your point differences in the number of pages mine was published in serdar argic s was in no need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publications etc etc does it give you an idea the issue was not the number of pages the book has or the year first published and you tried to hide the whole point the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed tortured etc by armenians and those quotes given by serdar argic exist it was the issue wasn t it you were not able to object it does it bother you anyway you name all these tortures and murders by armenians as a crap people who think like you are among the main reasons why the world still has so many craps in the any question serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve

around or later for cypriot greeks or any greeks rather than talking nonsense like above i will be glad to read what they got how can you be in a position to know about any kind of concentration camps akgun living through those days at the age of and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position in turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time forget about internal news agencies i haven t heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with greek cypriot prisoners in turkey however i heard adana pow camp it was not secret and well recognized pow camp as for all the registered prisoners to the red cross having returned to their homes this is your version of the story there are cases in which prisoners who were registered some of them even sent messages to their relatives were not released these are undeniable facts i see they vanished in turkish labor camps turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them is that it what do you think happened to them i thought that mia s are only the subject of rambo and chuck noris movies seems that i am wrong as for their treatment being according to what convention okay we believe you you don t need to belive me turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history it has been a respected and continuous member of un since the inception of un no body ever questioned the un membership of turkey because of what had happened in a and after only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the internal greek loby i know what you would say next let me answer it before wasting anytime yes un had a few condemning resolutions against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem especially after the coup well us and israel had a few too what can i say i am sure during athens junta duruing greeks had their own share too closed matter today between turkish cypriots turks greeks greek cypriots there is no more any official demand from greek cypriots about any missing greek cypriots where have you heard that there is no official demand regarding the missing persons have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks mediated by gali there was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties was there i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and international press he keeps saying that this was no longer an issue for peace talks also you don t want me fish for the greek cypriot politician s words that argic had posted zillion times describing missing peoples as a greek cypriot myth seems that there is a different opinions among greek cypriots as well about missing people in turkish custody your claim that the majority of the missing persons were infact killed in the period between the coup d eta and the invasion days is simply not true all the cases of missing persons i know and i know quite a few are cases of people who were either in the reserve forces and were lost somewhere in the battlefield or were civilians who were taken prisoners in their villages by the turkish army i am not claiming anything i just told you what was given to greek cypriots as an answer by turkish goverment turkish cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between july and the final cease fire in late august this answer seems to satisfy the international community the un and the vasilu goverment since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks also i am not aware of any un condemnation against turkey about any missing greek cypriot are you btw do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup d eta and nobody got hurt in those events as of the few photos which you refer to there are more than a few there are photos not only of greek cypriot soldiers being rounded up but also others in the prison camp in turkey like i said before there is even a different opinion among greek cypriots for this myth the officers in turkish army who governed the adana pow camp must be hell of clever dudes to cover up their tracks i hope turkish army does t have same type of morons for the security of turkiye however this must a good subject for a movie script one should inform oliver stone about this of course not the justice was served well if and when the bosnian pleas are answered who s going to dare to ask what happens to those masterminds behind the ethnic cleansing idea they are known today as eoka b masterminds were known in to everybody and are doing it openly even giving tv interviews it may take

talk.politics.mideast	re was go hezbollah i will try to answer some of dorin s questions even though they were not addressed to me specifically but i feel that i am a bit concerned by the thread since i am a southern lebanese from a village that is often on the receiving end of israel s bombs in the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied lebanese terrritory is not an act of terrorism or murder it is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder this exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth it seems to me dorin that you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation i will try to paint the most accurate picture i can of what the situation really is in south lebanon in article apr unocal com stssdxb st unocal com dorin baru writes is there any israeli a civilian in your opinion now i do not condone myself bombing villages any kind of villages but you claim these are villages with civilians and iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists you claim that israelis shell the villages with the hope of finding a terrorist or so if they kill one fine if not too bad civilians die right i am not so sure i am i was back in my home village this last summer for your information we are people not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business some work in the fields some own small shops others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee is that so hard to imagine it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc some young men usually aged between to years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where an year old girl just happened to be we are now accustomed to israeli tactics and we figure that this is the israeli way of telling us that if you re gonna hurt our soldiers you re gonna pay the price we accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers israel s retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw the people of south lebanon are occupied or shelled by israel on a regular basis we do not want to be occupied if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land we are not asking for the establishment of a lebanese occupied zone in northern israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by israel so the best policy seems to be the removal of israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so called security zone before the conclusion of the peace talks such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israel s public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon if you ask me those questions i will have no problem answering not with a question as you did no nobody is qualified candidate for murder nothing justifies murder i agree only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing cannot be qualified as murder no matter what you say i have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements maybe after eliminating all israelis jews am i wrong yes we have no quarrel with jews or israeli civilians the real problem is with occupying israeli soldiers and those brave israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an occupying soldier is attacked dorin basil

operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm s way are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers your damn right israel insists on some sort of demilitarized or buffer zone its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of arab states and watched as the states did nothing it is not exactly surprizing that israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti israel guerillas in residence i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled good lord brad what in the world goves you the idea that un troops stop anything they are only stationed in a country because that country allows them in it can ask them to leave at any time as nasser did in and somehow with that limitation on the troops powers i don t think that israel is going to be any more comfortable without a genuine commitment to peace from the arab states and concrete not intellectual or political exercises in jargon guarantees by other parties the un is worthless to israel but perhaps useful as a ruse this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate if however you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic groups if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so called security zone before the conclusion of the peace talks such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israel s public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re taking the buffer zone and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it from israel s perspective concessions gets it nothing except the realization that it has given something up and now can only hope that the other side decides to do likewise words can be taken back by merely doing so to take back tangible items land control of land requires the sort of action you say israel should stay away from israel put up with attacks from arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of lebanon the entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the arab state involved that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the acts committed by private groups israel would prepare for the next round of attacks what would israel want to return to those days and don t be so idiotic as to suggest trust for the motivations of present day arab states there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances ah ok what is different about the present situation that tells us that the arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic policies towards israel now don t talk about vague political factors but about those tangible just like that which israel gave up factors that guarantee the responsibility of those states your assessment of difference here is based on a whole lot of assumptions and most states don t feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon basil it has not without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one sided and selectively naive

his time attacking greeks and armenians who just happen to be historical opponents of turkey the because the x soviet armenian government got away with the genocide of million turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide and they are doing it again are you so blind problem is everybody arab greek bulgar serb russian tartar circassian persian kurd is or has been an opponent who has been kurds r us armenians r not an ally this historic circumstance seems to have taken a certain toll on serdar perhaps he should be posting to alt raving nationalist rather than soc history excuse me we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination our troops surrounded village after village little resistance was offered our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets completed the work some of the tartars escaped of course they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey the rest were killed and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages they are quiet now those villages except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead ohanus appressian men are like that p a genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an attempt to exterminate a race this is the worst crime in history it happened to the turks in eastern anatolia and the armenian dictatorship million turks and kurds were killed in the worst ways imaginable it is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions but there is no denying the fact that the armenian genocide of million muslims happened people of turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the turkish genocide i understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the turkish genocide indeed took place despite the fact that the genocide of million turks has been well documented over the past six decades we cannot reverse the events of the past but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the atlantic so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race source bristol papers general correspondence container bristol to bradley letter of september i have it from absolute first hand information that the armenians in the caucasus attacked tartar turkish villages that are utterly defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants pillage the village and often burn the village lets get somethings straight why not armenians are no angels but they were subject to turkish genocide and the germans were subject to jewish genocide are you for real tell me halsall were you high on asala sdpa arf forgeries and fabrications when you wrote that where is your non existent list of scholars here is mine during the first world war and the ensuing years the armenian dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its centuries old policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by savagely murdering million muslims and deporting the rest from their year homeland the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the th century acted upon an entire people this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government and international political leaders such as u s ambassador mark

professor of turkish studies university of michigan so the list goes on and on and on now wait there is more mark alan epstein the ottoman jewish communities and their role in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries klaus schwarz werlag freiburg page during the fifteenth century when the ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the balkans there was considerable turmoil among the jewish communities in central and western europe even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized it is easy to understand the attraction which ottoman life particularly when compared to life in europe held for the jews there is no way to tell how many jews left christendom for the realm of the rising muslim ottomans but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from christian countries it is recorded that some jews fled to ottoman territory the regularity of these reports suggests that the ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of jewish families moving southward and eastward from western and central europe it is evident that the effects of plague late crusades and the general intolerance and persecution of jews in christian europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of jewish life which for more than two centuries was to be oriented toward muslim east page in the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the edirne jewish community was rabbi yitzhak sarfati the ashkenazi chief rabbi of the city he was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the edirne jewry in the fifteenth century sarfati himself was from christian europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there who upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the ottoman jews prevailed upon him to write their european coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate this remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the ottoman domains but described as well the ease of travel to palestine and the holy places an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there page the impression gained from the hebrew sources is that the jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the ottomans especially in comparison to relations with the christians of europe confirmation of the commonality of interests between muslims and jews is also indicated by the fact that european christians perceived the jews as allies of islam and were well aware of muslim jewish cooperation certainly the activity of important jewish financiers and politicians representing the ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed european sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers in addition it appears that christian pirates plundered turks and jews their sworn enemies and that europeans considered the jews to be agents who regularly reported to the ottomans there are well known examples of overt jewish support for the ottomans in the struggle against european powers the two best known instances of jewish support for the campaigning ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the jewish contributions to the conquests of buda in the early sixteenth century and of rhodes we also have reports of sympathy for the ottomans during the siege of chios an unpublished ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some greek towns page it is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of jews and muslims coincided frequently and all parties involved jews muslims and christians were aware of the situation page it seems that the relations between greeks and jews were not particularly cordial the two groups had little in common few common interests and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation rather than enmity if there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was that between muslims and jews neither of whom had much in common with the orthodox page the general impression of muslim jewish relations in the ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests from the earliest times the ottomans seem to have welcomed jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element the jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of jews from christian countries to ottoman domains page from the period before we have only a few indications that the ottoman jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward but the liberality of the ottomans in contrast to the intolerance of the byzantines and the protection and the security which the ottomans offered in comparison to conditions elsewhere leave little doupt that even then both the ottomans and the jews recognized their mutual interests page it is impossible to say how fundamental the jews were in the success of the ottomans in rebuilding istanbul or in ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century that they played an important role in both cannot be doupted it is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the ottomans as well as did the jews it is however unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between jews and the non jewish society in which they lived we must conclude that the ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the jews did certainly for the jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the ottoman empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home a version of rabbi sarfati s tzarfati letter is given by prof shaw page your cries and sobs reached us we have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the german lands i hear the lamentation of my brethren the barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people the priests and prelates of rome have risen they wish to root out the memory of jacob and erase the name of israel they always devise new persecutions they wish to bring you to the stake listen my brethren to the counsel i will give

taxes and our commerce is free and unhindered rich are the fruits of the earth everything is cheap and every one of us lives in peace and freedom here the jew is not compelled to wear a yellow hat as a badge of shame as is the case in germany where even wealth and great fortune are a curse for a jew because he therewith arouses jealousy among the christians and they devise all kinds of slander

quite well that greece and the greek cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with greece someday whatever the cost to the parties involved the history speaks for itself greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on july in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of archibishop makarios following the greek cypriot attempt to annex the island to greece with the aid of the greek army turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island turkish cypriots for those turkish cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since the release of nikos sampson a member of eoka national organization of cypriot fighters and a convicted terrorist shows that the enosis mentality continues to survive in greece one should not forget that sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the turks in cyprus committed murder to achieve this goal and tried to destroy the island s independence by annexing it to greece of course the greek governments will have to bear the

neighbours mrs ayshe of mora her daughter ishin and mrs ayshe s sister novber were also with us we were all sitting having supper all of a sudden bullets from the pedieos river direction started to

hakan in her arms suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open greeks had come in and were combing every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets during these moments i heard voices saying in greek you want taksim eh and then bullets started flying in the bathroom mrs ilhan and her three children fell into the bath they were shot at this moment the greeks who broke into the bathroom emptied their guns on us again i heard one of the major s children moan then i fainted when i came to myself or hours later i saw mrs ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath i and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded but what had happened to my wife then i remembered and immediately ran to the toilet where in the doorway i saw her body she was brutally murdered in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying help help is there no one to save us i became terrified i thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not dead they would kill me so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the double bed an our passed by in the distance i could still hear shots my mouth was dry so i came out from under the bed and drank some water then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago there i offered sweets to mrs ayshe her daughter and mrs novber who were all wounded we waited in the bathroom until o clock in the morning i thought morning would never come we were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital finally as we could walk mrs novber and i went out into the street hoping to find help and walked as far as koshklu chiftlik there we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on when i regained my consciousness i said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs ayshe and her daughter after staying three days in the hospital i was sent by plane to ankara for further treatment there i

arrangements will be settled by a committee composed of representatives of the five permanent members of the un security council the secretary general of the un the pisga jordan egypt syria and israel but perhaps the bargaining attitude behind these very different visions of the interim stage is wrong for two reasons the present palestinian and israeli leadership are as moderate as is likely to exist for many years so the present opportunity may be the last for a significant period since these negotiations are not designed to or even attempting to resolve the conflict attention to issues dealing with a desired final status are mis placed and potentially destructive given this how should proposals from either side be altered to temper their maximalist approaches as stated above how can israeli worries and desire for some interim control be addressed while providing for a very real interim palestinian self governing entity tim april response by al moore l lmsc is lmsc lockheed com basically the problem is that israel may remain or leave the occupied territories it cannot do both it cannot do neither so far israe continues to propose that they remain the palestinians propose that they leave why should either change their view it is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the israeli presence israel proposes no such reduction and in fact may be said to not be negotiating tim there seem to be two perceptions that have to be addressed the first is that of israel where there is little trust for arab groups so there is little support for israel giving up tangible assets in exchange for pieces of paper expectations hopes etc the second is that of the arab world palestinians where there is the demand that these tangible concessions be made by israel without it receiving anything tangible back given this the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by israel of receiving some tangible returns for its expected concessions by tangible is meant something that provides israel with comparable protection from the land it is to give up in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine will be accountable and held actively not just diplomatically responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory by citizens or visitors in essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel was assured that any new palestinian state would be committed to co existing with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel from its territory aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above how could such guarantees be instilled for example how could such guarantees controls be added to the palestinian pisga proposals israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go gives lands back to arab states no more buffer zone gives full autonomy to palestinians any and or all of the arab parties could and would if not controlled somehow easily return to the traditional anti israel position the question then is how to really ensure that that will not happen tim

the holocaust turkey s role in rescuing turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution shaw chairs the undergraduate interdepartmental degree program in near eastern studies and has organized the program for the study of ottoman and turkish jewry he is affiliated with the g e von grunebaum center for near eastern studies editor how did you come to write these two books on turkey and european and turkish jews shaw basically i m an ottoman historian but i m also jewish i ve spent twenty five years studying ottoman history and as time went along whenever i found materials on the ottoman jews i collected them but i never did anything with them until a couple of years ago when i suddenly realized that was the th anniversary of the jews being expelled from spain and coming to turkey then the sephardic temple down on wilshire avenue invited me to give a series of three lectures on ottoman jewry these lectures were greatly appreciated and i became motivated to undertake further research to develop a book the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic this book is quite different from the works of most jewish historians who tend to look at the jews in any country more from the viewpoint of the jews and the jewish community and rely mainly on jewish sources i view my subject as an ottoman historian and i approach the jews of the ottoman empire largely from the point of view of ottoman society using largely ottoman sources after i finished this book and sent it to the press i came across additional documents relating to turkish jews during world war ii in the completed book i had said that turkey had done a good deal to rescue the jews during world war ii but i did not actually have many details then i found a batch of documents in the foreign ministry archive relating to actions taken by turkish diplomats to help the jews before and during the holocaust it was too late to add this new information to the book in press so i decided to write a second book i conducted further research mainly in the archives of the foreign ministry in ankara and the turkish embassy and consulate in paris the result was the second book turkey and the holocaust which details how turkey helped rescue jews from the nazis how exactly did they do this the story takes place over a number of years the book presents the material in three parts first of which deals with the period before the holocaust when the nazis came to power in germany in they immediately started dismissing jews and anti nazi germans from universities hospitals scientific institutes and the like turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its universities and it saw in these jews who were being fired from their positions in germany a good source of new talent to help modernize the turkish universities within three months after the nazis started dismissing these jews turkey arranged to take many of them in they were brought to turkey and were given appointments as professors in the turkish universities as heads of scientific institutes and as medical personnel in hospitals about to major jewish professors came to turkey in the s ernst reuter a german political scientist spent the war years teaching political science in turkey after world war ii he was mayor of berlin during the berlin airlift fritz neimark a major german jewish economist came to turkey and helped establish a modern school of economics in istanbul a man named reichenbach who was rescued from the nazis by turkey and spent the war years in turkey eventually came to ucla where he became a professor of philosophy other german jewish emigres engaged in cultural activities in turkey one such was karl ebert who had been a leading theatrical producer in berlin until he was expelled by the nazis he went to turkey where he organized the turkish national theater and the turkish national opera company in ankara with the help of paul hindemuth so the first section of the book covers this first phase when jews were being persecuted in germany and rescued by turkey oddly enough the german emigres when they were in turkey did not seem to think too badly of germany they regarded themselves more as germans than jews and they did not join in the anti nazi activities of the local turkish jewish community i even found letters from the nazi representatives to turkey praising these german jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea of german culture even though these people had been persecuted by the nazis and rescued by the turks they shared the nazis feelings of aryan racial superiority over the turks the second part of the book deals with the holocaust which began in when the nazis occupied france in europe at that time and especially in france there were about turkish jews they had migrated to europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward most of them had settled in europe during the turkish war for independence after world war i when greece was threatening to overrun turkey the greeks had persecuted the jews throughout the nineteenth century and the jews feared what might happen to them if the greeks took over in turkey many jews fled to france during the s and s many also abandoned their turkish citizenship and became french citizens suddenly the nazis invaded france in and started introducing all sorts of anti jewish laws the turkish jews soon found that it was not worth very much to be a french jew but that it was worth a lot to be a turkish jew how so turkey remained neutral through most of world war ii it retained its embassies and consulates in all the nazi occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the allies at the end of during the war therefore turkey was in a position to defend its citizens against anti jewish measures and the actions that turkish diplomats took form the second chapter of the book turkish diplomats who were stationed in france in particular intervened to protect jews of turkish citizenship from the nazis for those turkish jews who had retained their turkish citizenship there was generally no problem if they were arrested and sent to a concentration camp the turkish diplomats would communicate with the commanders of the camp and other officials and say in effect these people are turkish citizens you can t do this to them and the turkish jews would be released if their businesses were confiscated the turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored the nazis in general wanted to keep the friendship of turkey they hoped to be able to use turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the middle east and they also wanted to obtain chromium and manganese from turkey in order to keep turkish friendship they usually accepted these interventions on behalf of turkish jews the turkish diplomats sometimes went to the concentration camps to secure the release of turkish jews at times they even boarded trains hauling turkish jews to auschwitz for extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train most of the foreign jews were sent to a concentration camp at a place called drancy in paris and that s where most of the intercession by turkish consuls took place the greater problem came with the turkish jews who had abandoned their turkish citizenship and had become french citizens the consuls couldn t declare that these people were turkish citizens because they were not my book includes photographs of jews lining up in front of the turkish consulate either to get passports to return to turkey or to get a restoration of their turkish citizenship this was a bureaucratic matter so processing the application would take some time in the meantime it was a real emergency because the nazis would arrest jews on the streets for almost nothing the nazis would even arrest them if they had radios or telephones in their apartments because radios and telephones were forbidden to jews to take care of these former turkish jews the turkish diplomats invented a document called gayri muntazem vatandash or irregular fellow citizen the document said in effect this person is a former turkish citizen who has applied for the restoration of his turkish citizenship in the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat him as if he were a turkish citizen the diplomats wrote the document in turkish and put their seals on it since the nazis could not read turkish on the whole they accepted these papers as certificates of citizenship by this means the turkish diplomats were able to rescue many jews who had relinquished their turkish citizenship actually the nazis were of two minds about the turkish defense of jews on the one hand the nazi foreign ministry which wanted to retain the friendship of turkey was in favor of accepting these interventions on the other hand himmler and eichmann wanted all jews exterminated at times himmler and eichmann were able to prevail and some of the turkish jews were sent off to auschwitz before the turkish consuls could do anything do you have statistics on how many turkish jews were rescued there were about turkish jews in europe before world war ii about of whom were living in france most of the information in this section of the book relates to the situation in france i have published the letters that the turkish consuls sent to the nazi officials and the letters that came back in reply generally the nazis said that if the turkish consul would present documents certifying that arrested individuals are turkish citizens and promise to send them out of france the nazis would release them from the concentration camp the turkish consuls also organized special trains to take turkish jews from nazi occupied territory back to turkey these trains ran regularly in and the nazis gave the turkish jews visas so they could pass out of nazi territory but the trains were often held up by the nazi influenced governments of eastern europe croatia serbia and bulgaria because these governments really didn t want the jews to escape as a result of the turkish consuls efforts about to of the turkish jews in france were saved another were sent off to auschwitz where most of them died the remaining either escaped across the border into spain or fled to the area of southern france occupied by the italians who treated jews much better than the nazis did at the end of however italy fell out of the war and that was the end for those jews as well incidentally the turkish diplomats in nazi occupied greece also worked to rescue jews in that country the second part of your book then deals with turkish diplomats acting to rescue jews of turkish citizenship or turkish origin from nazi persecution yes and there is an aside i might add here in their interventions on behalf of turkish jews the turks cited their treaty with germany which stated that turkish citizens in german territory would be treated the same as german citizens in turkey on that basis the turks maintained that the nazis could not discriminate against turkish citizens who are jews the nazis claimed and the vichy government agreed that they were not discriminating because they were treating all jews equally turkey protested saying you are dividing our citizens according to religion but the turkish constitution requires that all citizens be treated equally regardless of religion therefore you cannot single out turkish jews american consuls in paris by contrast accepted the nazi argument and told american jews who were being persecuted by the nazis that they couldn t do anything about it because the american jews were being treated the same as other jews the third part of the book takes place in turkey which was the principal center during the holocaust for activities aimed at the rescue of eastern european jews the kwish agency an organization established by jews in palestine to help resettle jews to palestine set up an office in istanbul in under the leadership of chaim barlas other jewish organizations in palestine especially the kibbutzes also sent representatives to istanbul to set up headquarters these groups first tried to contact jews in eastern europe to find out what was happening today we know about the holocaust but at that time people didn t know what was going on they didn t imagine the nazis could do the things they were doing and so the first step was to get information and the turkish government let them use the turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends in eastern europe the jewish organizations found out what was happening when they received replies later on when the nazis began to intercept such letters the jews received assistance also from the vatican nuncio angelo roncali who served as the vatican representative in istanbul from to and later became pope john xxiii as the vatican representative during the war he used the facilities of the catholic church to supplement what the turkish government was doing to assist jewish agencies in contacting jews in eastern europe with the cooperation of the turkish government these agencies then sent hard currency food clothing and even railroad and steamship tickets to jews in czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and hungary they weren t able to help much in poland because by then the nazis had wiped out almost all the polish jews whenever possible the rescue agencies arranged for the jews to get out of eastern europe either by train through the so called orient express route to istanbul or by boat through the black sea to istanbul turkey was not eager for all these refugees to remain within its borders during the war because it was being blockaded and was suffering terrible shortages of food and clothing the government therefore facilitated the movement of the non turkish jewish refugees from turkey to palestine either by the taurus express railroad through the mountains to syria and palestine or by small boats across the eastern mediterranean from southern turkey to palestine these efforts were bitterly opposed not only by the nazis but also by the british who did not want any more jewish immigration to palestine because they feared it would hurt their relations with the arabs the british constantly pressured the turkish government to stop this traffic and send those jews back in a few cases the turkish government yielding to british pressure did send the boats back for example in one incident the steamship struma with some jewish refugees from romania was sent back by the turkish government as a result of the intervention of the british ambassador when that ship was sunk by a soviet submarine all were lost except one person nevertheless all told the turkish government allowed no fewer than eastern european jews to pass through turkish territory and move on to palestine during the second world war the turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities and money and gave them permission to send money and food out of the country many of these jews who passed through turkey may still be living in israel yes and their children but let s return for a moment to the first group the turkish jews who came from europe they did not go on to palestine they stayed in turkey it was the non turkish eastern european jews who passed through turkey en route to palestine their story is very interesting and you have rescued it from obscurity many studies have been made of the holocaust but most of them do not focus on the eastern european or middle eastern jews most of the scholarship has centered on the western european jews of whom million were massacred by the nazis my study deals with a much smaller number of people i have tried to round out the picture and i hope my book will persuade other scholars to undertake further investigations in the history of eastern jews when it comes to numbers the german jews were also relatively small in number most of the millions slain were polish jews the rescue of eastern european jews may not seem so significant compared with the total of million who were murdered but it meant a lot to those who were saved about three fourths of the book consists of documents translations of many documents they are included because the story is not well known not only are people in the west unaware of the courageous actions of the turkish diplomats even the people of turkey did not know the story i felt that they would not fully understand this remarkable achievement unless they could see the documents what languages are used in the documents most of them are in turkish or french some are in hebrew there is a great deal of material in hebrew about the organization of the boats going to palestine the passengers and so on but i did not go into those details extensively i describe mostly what turkey did so most of my documents are in turkish or french a few documents are in english the jewish groups in istanbul did not necessarily cooperate with one another to rescue jews in fact they often fought with one another they took turns trying to get the turkish government to deport rival groups for example some of the kibbutz groups felt that the jewish agency was run by western european jews who were interested only in helping western european jews finally in president roosevelt sent a personal representative ira hirschman who had been an executive of bloomingdale s department store in new york city and hirschman managed to reconcile their differences the documents related to his mission are in english i also obtained many documents from serge klarsfeld a holocaust historian in france who mainly worked on the french jews his father was killed by the nazis he gave me materials he had gathered in the german archives on the turkish jews so i didn t personally consult the german archives i believe that much more can be learned from the german archives and i hope someone someday will make the effort this new book fits in well with your teaching doesn t it right i m giving a course on the history of the jews of the ottoman empire i first gave the course two years ago in addition to research writing and teaching i ve been actively involved in the commemoration of the th anniversary of the coming of the jews to the ottoman empire among other things i helped organize a large international conference on the subject which was held in istanbul in now that your books are finished and the conference has taken place what do you plan to do next i m working on two new books one is a history of the turkish war for independence which took place after world war i during the years to the turks warded off the efforts of the victorious european powers to occupy turkey and end its independence the second book

she is simply letting the world know that she will no longer sit there quiet and let turks get away with their famous tricks armenians do remember of the turkish invasion of the greek island of cypress while the world simply watched and the turkish karabag is next as for cyprus in turkiye stepped into cyprus to preserve the lives of the turkish population there this is nothing but a simple historical fact unfortunately the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority the problems in cyprus have their origin in decades of oppression of the turkish population by the greek cypriot officials and their violation of the co founder status of the turks set out in the constitution the coup d etat engineered by greece in to execute a final solution to the turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked turkiye s intervention turkiye intervened reluctantly and only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues consulting with britain and greece as the other two signatories to the treaty to protect the integrity of cyprus there simply was not any expansionist motivation in the turkish action at all this is in dramatic contrast to the greek motivation which was openly expansionist stated as enosis union with greece since the creation of independent cyprus in the turkish population although smaller legally had status as the co founder of the republic with the greek population the greek cypriots with the support of enosis minded greeks in the mainland have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the island as a greek island with a minority population of turks the turks of cyprus are not a minority in a greek republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their autonomy in a separate republic turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo she would rather not be involved with the island but given the dismal record of brutal greek oppression of the turkish population in cyprus she simply cannot leave the fate of the island s turks in the hands of the greeks until the turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob turkish cypriots of their rights liberties and their very lives source cyprus the tale of an island a h rizvi p throughout cyprus following the greek cypriot premeditated onslaught of december the turkish sectors all over cyprus were completely besieged by greeks all

quarter of nicosia and suburbs greek cypriot armed elements broke into hundreds of turkish homes and fired at the unarmed occupants with automatic weapons killing at random many turks including women children and elderly persons turks were killed and wounded they also carried away as hostages more than turks including women and children whom they forced to walk bare footed and in night dresses

their right to freedom of movement in his report no s of december to the security council the un secretary general stated in this respect the following restrictions on the free movement of civilians

this appears to mean milan it seems that some greek has fucked you is that what turns you on the truth needs to be told over and over again there are armenians who of course witnessed the armenian genocide of million muslim people between but their voices of truth are suppressed today in the hollow din of anti turkish muslim campaign by the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle of the fascist x soviet armenian government well that is what i saw in the library what s your problem with this source k s papazian patriotism perverted baikar press boston pp it seems that terrorism against their own co nationals has been a prominent part of the revolutionary activities of the dashnag leaders of the caucasus organized to fight the turks these chieftains have been more successful in their fight against their armenian opponents in turkey and the caucasus very often defenseless and innocent p the fact remains however that the leaders of the turkish armenian section of the dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the turkish cause when the turks entered the war and a call was sent for armenian volunteers to fight the turks on the caucasian front p thousands of armenians from all over the world flocked to the standards of such famous fighters as antranik kery dro etc the armenian volunteer regiments rendered valuable service to the russian army in the years of source adventures in the near east by a rawlinson jonathan cape bedford square london first published pages memoirs of a british officer who witnessed the armenian genocide of million muslim people p second paragraph i had received further very definite information of horrors that had been committed by the armenian soldiery in kars plain and as i had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their treatment of my own detached parties i had wired to tiflis from zivin that in the interests of humanity the armenians should not be left in independent command of the moslem population as their troops being without discipline and not under effective control atrocities were constantly being committed for which we should with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible p third paragraph armenian troops who having pillaged and destroyed all the moslem villages in the plain caravans of refugees were in the meanwhile constantly arriving from the plain from which the whole moslem population was fleeing with as much of their personal property as they could transport seeking to obtain security and protection p first paragraph in those moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for arms by the armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such search and not only had many moslems been killed but horrible tortures had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where valuables had been hidden of which the armenians were aware of the existence although they had been unable to find them p first paragraph shortly afterwards the head of the miserable column appeared there were in all about persons mostly old men and women and children with a few ox carts ponies and donkeys carrying all their worldly possessions except a few sheep that they were driving before them their leader interviewed bekir bey and was told to keep farther on into the hills where he would be able to cross the frontier into turkey unmolested by his enemies p first paragraph the armenians from the plain were attacking the kurdish line with artillery with probably a large force in support p first paragraph the arrival of this british brigade was followed by the announcement that kars province had been allotted by the supreme council of the allies to the armenians and that announcement having been made the british troops were then completely withdrawn and armenian occupation commenced hence all the trouble for the armenians at once commenced the wholesale robbery and persecution of the muslem population on the pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms in the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able to carry out their purpose and the manner in which this was

is a turkish name before before the russians and their zavalli kole armenians drove all the turks muslims out it was a turkish majority town well anyway it is not surprising that armenians also collaborated with the nazis wholly opportunistic the dashnaktzoutun have been variously pro nazi pro russia pro soviet armenia pro arab pro jewish as well as anti jewish anti zionist anti communist and anti soviet whichever was expedient john roy carlson arthur derounian cairo to damascus alfred a knopf new york p as a dear friend put it the tzeghagrons armenian racial patriots was the youth organization of the dashnaktzoutun it was based in boston where asala sdpa arf terrorism triangle is located but had followers in armenian colonies all over the world literally tzeghagron means to make a religion of one s race the architect of the armenian racial patriots was garegin nezhdeh a nazi armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with hitler in world war ii in he had been invited to the united states by the central committee of the dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the american armenian youth nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local armenian youth groups in the tzeghagrons starting with chapters in the initial year the tzeghagrons grew to chapters and became the largest and most powerful nazi armenian organization nezhdeh also provided the tzeghagrons with a

about men women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four year war over nagorny karabakh the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials and casualty lists published in the baku press diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates the february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four year campaign to take full control of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations in rome on monday the bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians the awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief stricken azerbaijan s wild and contradictory allegations of up to dead the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali disaster said his figure of people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings a similar estimate was given by elman memmedov the mayor of hojali an even higher one was printed in the baku newspaper ordu in may dead people named and more than bodies reported unidentified this figure of nearly dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman of the azeri ministry of defence francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the international red cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city of agdam had reported a figure of bodies received at his mosque from hojali most of them civilians we did not count the bodies but the figure seems reasonable it is no fantasy mr zen ruffinen said we have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre don t get worked up it will take several months to get a final figure the year old lawyer said at his small office mr rasulov knows about these things it took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that people were killed and wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in baku in january those nationalists the popular front finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians officially people have so far been certified as dead being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic s forensic department this is just a small percentage of the dead said rafiq youssifov the republic s chief forensic scientist they were the only bodies brought to us remember the chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within hours of these people were women and were children under years old gunshots killed people shrapnel killed and axes or blunt instruments killed exposure in the highland snows killed the last three thirty three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor youssifov s report those bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed mr rasulov said files from mr rasulov s investigative commission are still disorganised lists of azeri militiamen are dead here six policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the names of corpses brought to be washed in just one day the most heartbreaking account from witnesses interviewed so far comes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on february there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly in hojali people by the stream and the road and visible around nakhchivanik village mr manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot people waved up to us for help we saw three dead children and one two year old alive by one dead woman the live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up we tried to land but armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by armenian forces the independent london serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination ohanus appressian in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul sahak melkonian

turks who bear the responsibility of the things happening today that is hard to believe for somebody trying to be objective when it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides what were you doing on anatolia after the ww anyway do you think it was your right to be there there were a couple millions of greeks living in asia minor until someone had to protect them if not us who is that so or you were taking advantage of weakness of ottoman empire to grab some land as soon as you got green lights from allied forces you occupied izmir and other cities in western turkey you killed and raped millions people without any reason of course you paid the price mustafa kemal ataturk made you swim in aegean sea but not far enough your aggressions thru turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall not get you anywhere i am not saying that conflicts started with that it is only not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering it is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey i thought it was a positive attempt to make the relations better compromise on what the invasion of cyprus the involment of turkey in greek politics the refusal of turkey to accept miles of territorial waters as stated by international law the properties of the greeks of konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the greek lake sorry aegean what compromise are you talking about on cyprus that is not greece business to join the island to greece that is up to people in the island to live or not to live together they made their decision and they are living separetely now there is a peace there greeks can t slaughter turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there your dream will never come true mile territorialwater are you joking or dreaming we can declare our miles territorial water which can come close to athens how would you like it if you have any guts why don t you shoot at some turkish ships in your dream mile territorial waters we do not have any city called konstantinople we have a city called istanbul all the greeks in istanbul are being treated just any other turks there is no difference among people in turkey you look at your own backyard first before talking about human rights in turkey what are the rights of turks in greece nothing they do not even have basic human rights like right to have property fredom of religion fredom of press fredom of vote elect their community leaders government of greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools religious places houses and farms belong to turkish minority then greek government forces these minorities to go to turkey without anything with them you will dream to see aegean sea as greek lake but it will never happen think about the war between turkey and greece in the river called sakarya flood days filled with blood in the greeks i mentioned who wouldn t talk to me are educated people they have never met me but they know i am bad person because i am from turkey politics is not my business and it is not the business of most of the turks when it comes to individuals why the hatred any person who supports the policies of the turkish goverment directly or indirecly is a bad person it is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support of the actions of your goverment that make you bad people do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you are you are a supporter of the policies of the turkish goverment and as a such you must pay the price you mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the government of greece is a good person that is your greek idea to say turks are bad people we know who we are and proud to be turks anywhere in the world that is not greeks business to tell us what kind of people we are you are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen their rights are taken away from them and they have no voices under the government of greece they are almost being treated as slaves even though we are getting into th century therefore do not make me laught at you so that makes me think that there is some kind of brainwashing going on in greece after all why would an educated person treat every person from a nation the same way can you tell me about your history books and things you learn about greek turkish encounters during your schooling take it easy you do not need brainwashing to turn people against the turks just as greeks arats slavs kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under turkish occupation they will talk to you about murders rapes distruction you do not learn about turks from history books you learn about them from people who experienced first hand turkish friendliness the government of greece is actively supporting terrorism against turkey armenian and kurdish terrorists have headquarters in athens they are being trained in special camps in greece they are taught how to kill innocent women and children this not a claim this is a fact known by whole world in conlusion you are in action to murder rape destroy the innocent people i do not take you seriously because you are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity your own government the government of greece actively supports atrocities in bosnia serbs s barbarism pleases your government please napoleon think twice before you write anything about turks and turkey you are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of the minorities who wants to be a fried with someone whose government does not respect the human rights supports terrorism in turkey barbaric actions in bosnia treats turkish minorities as third class

talk.politics.mideast	re jews islam dr frankenstien some of your article was cut off on the right margin but i will try and answer from what i can read in article c ssqe dps odin corp sgi com kaveh gate koi corp sgi com kaveh smith writes i have found jewish people very imagentative and creative jewish religion was the foundation for christianity and islam in other words judaism has fathered both religions now islam has turned against its father i may say it is ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise i thought the idea of believing on one god was to unite all man kind how come both jews and islam which believe on the same god the god of ebrahim are killing each other is this like dr frankenstien s story how are you going to stop this from happening how are you going to deal with so many muslims nuking them would distroy the whole world would god get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same god same heaven and the same hell after all what is the peacefull way of ending this saga judaism did not father islam we had many of the same prophets but judaism ignores prophets later prophets including jesus christ who christians and muslims believe in and mohammed the idea of believing in one god should unite all peoples however note that christianity and islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non christians and non muslims are stated in each religion man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state a religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society the praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it god does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes that god will help him when he prays religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life but the religious leaders need to make a living through religion so they may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to make their living i e muslims have to pay percent of their income to the mullahs i guess the rabie gets his cut too we are supposed to pay of our income after all necessities are paid please note that this is on a personal basis if you are poor there is no need to pay quite the contrary this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor muslims around the world also this money is not required in the human sense i e a muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid and we surely don t pass money baskets around during our prayer services is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other helps one another respect the mother nature is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will see the outcome of his choice how can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion how can we stop another religious killing field under poor gods name what are your thoughts do you think man kind would to come its senses before it is too late p s on the side do you think that moses saw the god on mount sina why would god go to top of the mountain he created the earth he could have been anywhere why on top the mountain was it because people thought to see god you have to reach to the skies heavens why god kept coming back to middle east was it because they created god through their imagination is that why jewish people were told by god they were the chosen ones god s presence is certainly on earth but since god is everywhere god may show signs of existence in other places as well we can not say for sure where god has shown signs of his existence and where he has not profit mohammad was married to khadijeh she was a jewish she taught him how to trade she probably taught him about judaism quran is mostly copy right of taurah sp old testement do you think god wrote quran makeh was a trade city before islam do you think it was made to be the center of islamic world because mohammad wanted to expand his trade business is that why god has put his house in there the qur an is not a copyright of the taurah muslims believe that the taurah the bible and the qur an originally contained much the same message thus the many similiarities however the taurah and the bible have been translated into other languages which has changed their meaning over time a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator s the qur an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in arabic therefore we know that mankind has not changed its meaning it is truly what was revealed to mohammed at that time there are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother s womb i think this religious stuff has gone too far all man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up look at david koresh how that turned out i am afraid in the bigger scale the jews and the muslims will have the same ending only god knows for sure how it will turn out i hope it won t but if that happens it was the will of god religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than plotting each others distruction there is one earth one life and one god let s all man kind be good toward each other god help us all peace please send this mail to me again so i can read the rest of what you said and yes may god help us all steve

murtezaoglu writes henrik country turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the henrik karabakh conflict with azerbaijan bm gimme a break capital letters or not the above is pure nonsense it bm seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities henrik again armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves what do henrik want them to do lay down their arms and let azeris walk all over them news reports i ve seen say otherwise both location and motives wise caps don t change facts bm while hoping that turkey will stay out stop and think for a moment bm will you armenia doesn t need anyone to drag her into the conflict it bm is a part of it henrik armenians knew from the begining that turks were fully engaged henrik training azeris militarily to fight against karabakhi armenians so should i at this point break into caps and start talking about defense etc i don t know how fully engaged turkey is was though henrik the karabakhi armenians who have lived in their homeland for henrik years cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin are the henrik ones directly involved in the conflict they are defending henrik themselves against azeri aggression bm huh you didn t expect azeri s to be friendly to forces fighting with them bm within their borders henrik well history is sad remember those are relocated azeris into henrik the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime so i hear this justifies bloodshed n years after the fact henrik at last i hope that the u s insists that turkey stay out of the henrik karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never henrik occur again bm you re not playing with a full deck are you where would turkey invade henrik it is not up to me to speculate but i am sure turkey would have stepped henrik into armenia if she could why would turkey do that do you not realize that this is a local clash that turkey never wished to see happen turkey has other plans for region like economic revival co operation etc good stuff in other words i d be happy to bicker with armenians over trade barriers and such on usenet rather than who killed whom in what way which i detest doing and wouldn t do bm are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with s c g in the header bm in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun henrik absolutely not i am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik cases history repeats itself even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke turkey as was done in if there d been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in athens at the time everybody would have stayed home with their families i have no wish to go into the cyprus quarrel but i suspect what i ve said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved bm yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes bm she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring bm the parties to the negotiating table that s hard to do when armenians bm are attacking azeri towns henrik so let me understand in plain words what you are saying turkey henrik wants a peaceful end to this conflict not so what do you think we want war death and destruction henrik i will believe it when i see it no if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it henrik now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a gun pointing henrik to your head do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef fat chance this kind of childish rhetoric doesn t help anthing henrik do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku all the henrik barberian acts especially against mothers and their children i mean henrik burning people alive now some azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by armenians one should re hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive right bm armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the bm futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that s bm going to cause incessant skirmishes henrik armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic they are henrik not asking much they simply want to get back what was taken away henrik from them and given to azeris by stalin well they obviously aren t getting anywhere with their current methods of asking not very peaceful i d say bm think of or years down the line both of the newly independent bm countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe bm the other out these people will be neighbors would it not be better bm to keep the bad blood between them minimal henrik don t get me wrong i also want peaceful solution to the henrik conflict but until azeris realize that the armenians in henrik karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion i don t know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans peace isn t what s happening right now furthermore what s happening right now isn t condusive to peace you can spend days and nights raving about how right the armenian position is and i m sure there ll be others who d be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side if entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise armenia isn t strong enough to exercise the we think we re right and we have the bombs so we ll do whatever we want so there style of foreign relations yes you can type stalin in caps and give one sided atrocity stories etc but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side you personally can choose not to do that of course this being just usenet the people in power shouldn t be so childish bm if you belong to the armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes bm your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of bm their blood and future henrik again you are taking different turns armenia has no intension henrik to grab any land from azerbaijan the armenians in karabakh henrik are simply defending themselves until a solution is set azeri s would disagree with you on this and the maps i ve seen support what they d be saying it doesn t seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner bm it s easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled the armenians bm in armenia and n k will be there with the same people you seem to hate bm as their neighbors for maybe years more the sooner there s peace in bm the region the better it is for them and everyone else i d push for bm compromise if i were you instead of hitting the caps lock and spreading bm inflammatory half truths henrik it is not up to me to decide the peace initiative i am absolutely henrik for it it didn t look it when i read your posting it would seem to me that if you can spew mis information about a boogey man you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness fair henrik but in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself henrik you will be wiped out such as the case in the era of of henrik the armenian massacres you don t realize i can say the same thing about the turkish massacres yes boys and girls let s always talk about how bad and nasty things were let s do that so we re overwhelmed by anger and let s do that so our kids will also be hateful sounds crazy doesn t it don t do it then bm

terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc some young men usually aged between to years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians this a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm s way are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover are they not killing soldiers in their country if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back getting even it doesn t make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti israel guerillas in residence if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled good lord brad no i am not basil i think basil is a very intelligent person and i respect what he writes basil is a person that i would gladly call a friend he is however not me nor am i lebanese as some seem to suspect this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate if however you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic groups tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn t make the lebanese so mad as to do that furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon basil it has not without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border not lately eh israel knows very well that the syrians are able to restrain all who would use territory under their control to attack israel while lebanon would be better off with syria and israel out of its borders the presence of syrian troops in lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on israeli territory not on israeli troops in lebanon however please note the distinction in the past two years tim your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one sided and selectively naive i disagree basil has always seemed to me to be a cool headed person slow to anger certainly more so than i what is most important is that he is an actual witness to things from the other end of the israeli guns if only the israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were reversed perhaps they would moderate their retaliation brad hernlem hernlem chess ncsu edu

about the s that s about years there many people alive today who were born in a city called konstantinoupolis i know it doesn t make sense but since when is napoleon about sense anyway further striking bigoted and racist attitude of certain greeks still exists in our day most greeks insist even today that the year old capital of the ottoman empire should be called not by its rightful name of istanbul but by its half a millennium old moniker cons whatever everyone knows that new york city was once called new amsterdam but dutch people do not persist on calling it that today the name of stalingrad too is long gone replaced by volgagrad china s peking traded its name for beiging long ago ciudad trujillo of the dominican republic is now santa domingo zimbabve s old colonial capital salisburry became harrare these changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world but greeks are still determined on calling the turkish istanbul by the name of cons how can one explain this total intransigence what makes greeks so different from other mortals year old questionable democracy why don t they seem to reconcile with the fact for instance that istanbul changed hands years ago in ad and that this predates the discovery of the new world by years the declaration of u s independence in will come years later shouldn t then half a millennium be considered enough time for cons to be called a turkish city where is the logic in the greek reasoning if there is any how long can one sit on the laurels of an ancient civilization ancient greece does not exist any more than any other civilizations that existed on the soil of anatolia these undereducated wieneramus live with an illusion it is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that cyprus is a greek island no history book shows that it ever was it belonged to the ottoman turks lock stock and barrel for a period of well over years in fact prior to the turks acquisition of it following bloody naval battles with the venetians in ad the island of cyprus belonged invariably to several nations the assyrians the sumerians the phoenicians the egyptians the ottoman turks of course in that order owned it as their territory but it has never been the possession of the government of greece not even for one day in the history of the world moreover cyprus is located miles from the greek mainland but only miles from turkiye s southern coastline saddam hussein claims that kuwait was once iraqi territory and the greek cypriot government and the terrorist greek governments think that cyprus also was once part of the greek hegemony those arromdians involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront reality again wishful thinking is unproductive only facts count as for selanik those jews who survived these assaults in southeastern europe fled particularly to salonica whose jewish population increased substantially as a result from in to in more than half the total population though even there increased persecution by local greeks led many jews to flee elsewhere in the ottoman empire particularly to the great port of izmir despite all the pressure from ottomans and foreign jews alike the ritual murders and other assaults by christians on jews went on and on greek efforts to decimate the jewish population of salonica culminated in and following greek conquest of salonica during the first balkan war when many of its jews were either killed or terrorized into leaving though greece was obligated by the post world war i treaties to allow jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance a law was issued in which forbad all inhabitants from working on sunday stimulating a new jewish exodus as it was intended to do between and there was a series of anti semitic riots in salonica with the cambel quarter where most of the remaining jews lived being burned to the ground this was followed by regulations requiring the use of greek and prohibiting hebrew and judea spanish in the jewish schools a start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal jewish cemetery in salonica for use by the new university in order to derive the jews out by killing and driving out large numbers of jews the greeks left a substantial greek majority in the city for the first time and starting salonica jewry on the way to its final decimation by the nazis during the occupation of greece starting in salonica and izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for jewish refugees entering the empire during its last century of existence istanbul edirne and other parts of rumelia and anatolia received thousands more nor were jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the sultan thousands of muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever balkan christian states gained independence or expanded the russian conquest of the crimea and the caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century and particularly during and after the crimean war combined with the same independence movements in southeastern europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its jews caused thousands of helpless ill and poverty stricken muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the ottoman empire with the istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could from to as many as crimean tatars circassians and other muslims from north and east of the

in to the azerbaijani border town of agdam and the bodies piled up in the morgues there was little doubt that khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been the site of the most

soviet attack helicopters in the azerbaijani service nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour our party was in the second crocodile the civilian helicopter s job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings the attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary the operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the soviet armed forces because our pilot was a russian officer an azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former soviet military helicopters and their pilots fighting for azerbaijan they have signed contracts to fly for us he said the helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother officer of our russian pilot but fighting for the armenians we had taken off just before pm on saturday

way the driver says in fact there aren t any armenians left they burned them all beat them all and stabbed them deposition of vanya bagratovich bazian born foreman baku spetsmontazh administration umsmr resident at building apartment block sumgait azerbaijan during the first days of the events the th and the th of february i was away on a business trip on the th i had got my crew done the paper work and left for the zhdanov district that s in azerbaijan near the nagorno karabagh region after the th rumors started to the effect that in karabagh specifically in stepanakert an uprising had taken place they said uprising in azerbaijani but i don t think it was really an uprising just a demonstration after that the unrest started several armenians living in the zhdanov district were injured how were they injured they were beaten even women it was said that they were at the demonstrations but they live here and went from here to karabagh to demonstrate after that i felt uneasy there were some conversations about armenians among the local population the armenians had done this the armenians had done that right there at the site i was attacked a couple of times by kids well true the guys from my crew wouldn t let them come at me with cables and knives after that i felt really bad i didn t know where to go i up and called home and my children tell me there s unrest everywhere be careful well i had a project going on i told the second secretary of the district party committee what had been going on and said i wanted to take my crew off the site they wouldn t allow it they said nothing s going to happen to you we ve entrusted the matter to the police we ve warned everyone in the district nothing will happen to you well in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me he knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened this man didn t leave me alone for five minutes he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us too i sense some disquiet and call home my wife also tells me the situation is very tense be careful we finished the job at the site and i left for sumgait first thing on the morning of the th when we left the guys warned me they told me that i shouldn t tell anyone on the way that i was an armenian i took someone else s business travel documents in the name of zardali and hid my own i hid it and my passport in my socks we set out for baku our guys were on the bus they sat behind and i sat up front in baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case as it turns out they knew what was happening in sumgait i arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of sumgait is closed there is no way to get there that the city is closed off and the buses aren t running buses normally leave baku for sumgait almost every two minutes and suddenly no buses well we tried to get there via private drivers one man an azerbaijani said let s go find some other way to get there they found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to sumgait he took us there but the others had said i wouldn t go if you gave me a thousand rubles why because they re burning the city and killing the armenians there isn t an armenian left well i got hold of myself so i could still stand up so we squared it away the four of us got in the car and we set off for sumgait on the way the driver says in fact there aren t any armenians left they burned them all beat them all and stabbed them well i was silent the whole way odd miles i was silent the driver asks me how old are you old man he wants to know if i m being that quiet not saying anything maybe it means i m an armenian how old are you he asks me i say i m i m too but i call you old man i say it depends on god each person s life in this world is different i look much older than my years that s why he called me old man well after that he was silent too we re approaching the city i look and see tanks all around and a cordon before we get to the kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand well he was waving his hand we all start waving our hands i m sitting there with them i start waving my hand too i realized that this was a sign that meant there were no armenians with us i look at the city there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street you know and there s no traffic well probably i was scared they stopped our car people were standing on the sidewalks they have armature shafts and stones and they stopped us along the way the driver tells us how they know who s an armenian and who s not the armenians usually for example i m an armenian but i speak their language very well well armenians usually pronounce the azeri word for nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh is actually correct the pronunciations are different anyone who says pundukh even if they re not armenian they immediately take out and start to slash another one says there was a car there with five people inside it he says they started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire and they didn t let the people out he says they wouldn t let them get out of the car i only saw the car but the driver says that he saw everything well he often drives from baku to sumgait and back when they stop us we all get out of the car i look and there s a short guy his eyes are gleaming he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one we re azerbaijani they tell him no armenians here he did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says maybe you re an armenian old man but in azerbaijani i say you should be ashamed of yourself and he left turned and left that was all that happened what was i to do i had to the city was on fire but i had to steal my children out of my own home they stopped us at the entrance to mir street that s where the kavkaz store and three large story buildings are that s the beginning of down town i saw that burned automobile there completely burned only metal remained i couldn t figure out if it was a zhiguli or a zaporozhets later i was told it was a zhiguli and the people in there were completely incinerated nothing remained of them not even any traces that driver had told me about it and i saw the car myself the car was there the skeleton a metallic carcass about to yards from the kavkaz store i see a military transport an armored personnel carrier the hatches are closed and people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it the crowd is and i hear shots not automatic fire it s true but pistol shots several shots there were azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier someone in the crowd was shooting apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or something at that point there was only one armored personnel carrier and all the tanks were outside the city cordoning off sumgait i walked on i see two azerbaijanis going home from the plant i can tell by their gait that they re not bandits they re just people walking home i joined them so in case something happened in case someone came up to us and asked questions either of us would be in a position to answer you see but i avoided the large groups because i m a local and might be quickly recognized i tried to keep at a distance and walked where there were fewer people well so i walked into microdistrict which is across from our block i can t get into our block but i walked where there were fewer people so as to get around well there i see a tall guy and to people are walking behind him and he s shouting into a megaphone comrades the armenian azerbaijani war has begun the police have megaphones like that so they re talking and walking around the second microdistrict i see that they re coming my way and turn off behind a building i noticed that they walked around the outside buildings and inside the microdistricts there were about or people standing on every corner and at the middles of the buildings and at the edges what they were doing i can t say because i couldn t get up close to them i was afraid but the most important thing was to get away from there to get home and at least find out if my children were alive or not april yerevan reference the sumgait tragedy

from there from the government why my husband was killed on the th when i returned from work it was a saturday my son was at home he doesn t work i went straight to the kitchen and he called me mamma is there a soccer game there were shouts from lenin street that s where we lived i say i don t know igor i haven t turned on the tv he looked again and said mamma what s going on in the courtyard i look and see so many people it s awful marching marching there are hundreds thousands you can t even tell how many there are they re shouting down with the armenians kill the armenians tear the armenians to pieces my god why is that happening what for i had known nothing at that point we lived together well in friendship and suddenly something like this it was completely unexpected and they

anymore i begged i pleaded i grieved i even got down on my knees he says let s bury him here now and in three months in six months a year if it calms down i ll help you move him to karabagh our trial was the first in sumgait it was concluded on may at the investigation the murderer tale ismailov told how it all happened but then at the trial he tried to wriggle he tried to soften his crime then they brought a videotape recorder i guess and played it and said ismailov look is that you he says yes well look here you re describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime right he says yes and now you re telling it differently he says well maybe i forgot like that the witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along mir street there was a crowd of about people shagen had a volga gaz the people surrounded his car and all of them were involved one of them was this ismailov guy this tale they it s unclear who started pulling shagen out of the car well one says from the left side of the car another says from the right side they pulled off his sports jacket he had a jacket on well they ask him what s your nationality he says armenian well they say from the crowd they shouted if he s an armenian kill him kill him they started beating him they broke seven of his ribs and his heart i don t know they did something there too it s too awful to tell about anyway they say this tale guy he had an armature shaft he says i picked it up it was lying near a bush that s where i got it he said he picked it up but the witnesses say that he had already had it he said i hit him twice he said once or twice on the head with that rod and he said that when he started to beat him shagen was sitting on the ground and when he hit him he fell over he said i left right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment killing someone he says and i came back to look is that shagen alive or not i said you wanted to finish him right and if he was still alive you came back to hit him again he went back and looked and he was already dead after that that bastard tale said after that i went home i said you you little snake i said are you a thief and a murderer shagen had had money in his jacket and a watch on his wrist they were taken he says he didn t take them when they overturned and burned the car that tale was no longer there it was other people who did that who it was who turned over the car and who burned it that hasn t been clarified as yet i told the investigator how can you have the trial when you don t know who burned the car he said something but i didn t get what he was saying but i said you still haven t straightened everything out i think that s unjust when they burned the car he was lying next to it and the fire spread to him in the death certificate it says that he had third degree burns over percent of his body and i ask again why was he killed my husband was a carpenter he was a good craftsman he knew how to do everything he even fixed his own car with his own hands we have three children three sons only igor was with me at the time the older one was in pyatigorsk and the younger one is serving in the army and now they re fatherless i couldn t sit all the way through it when the procurator read up to years deprivation of freedom i just i went out of my mind i didn t know what to do with myself i said how can that be you i said you are saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is years deprivation of freedom i screamed i had my mind i said let me at that creep with my bare hands i ll a relative restrained me and there were all those military people there i lest i said this isn t a soviet trial this is unjust that s what i shouted l said it and left i said that on february when those people were streaming down our street they were shouting long live turkey and glory to turkey and during the trial i said to that ismailov what does that mean glory to turkey i still don t understand what turkey has to do with this we live in the soviet union that turkey told you to or is going to help you kill armenians i still don t understand why glory to turkey i asked that question twice and

the eternal flame and saw a group of about to people standing there when i had walked another to yards i heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me i turned my head toward the sound it was a light blue gaz volga i see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the car a man and a woman get out the man is expensively dressed in a suit and the woman has a raincoat on she doesn t have anything on her head and her hair is let down sightly reddish hair a heavy set woman they re to years old they get something out of the trunk the people start to help them i become curious just what are they pulling out of there when i got up close i heard them turn something on i didn t see what it was but it was probably a tape recorder they put it on the ground near the eternal flame honoring the baku commissars and formed a tight circle around it i ask what s going on someone tells me come listen well they were azerbaijanis i had asked in azerbaijani i hear appeals brother muslims our time has come and something else along that line i didn t understand what it was all about i walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder but the

my daughter was at my aunt s house in baku i didn t say anything to my wife we sat and drank tea sometime around two o clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise whistling and shouting i looked out the window and saw a crowd the crowd is moving slowly like they show on tv when blacks in south africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly my wife asks what s going on out there i say i don t know i put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about in the crowd people are shouting down with the armenians and death to the armenians i waited for the entire crowd to pass at first they went down narimanov street on the side with the sk club and the city party committee then they turned and went against the traffic it s one way there down the street of the baku commissars toward the streetcar line i went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on in fact i thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in yerevan and in karabagh aside from the things they were shouting i was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd and they were minors under draft age my wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend but i was kind of uneasy and said no let s stay at home instead an hour went by or maybe an hour and a half well i wasn t keeping track of the time i can t say exactly how long it was i look and see another crowd on narimanov but now on the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the rossiya movie theater i put outside clothes on and went out again there s noise an uproar outside and the crowd has grown there are more people and whereas the first time there were individual shouts this time they are more focused more aggressive no i think something s wrong here this isn t any demonstration they would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dashes and then run again i was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street i followed them i was thinking i d just watch and see who knew where this was leading we came out on lenin square at the square the sk club is on one side and the city party committee is on the other i went toward the square and heard noise and shouting as though the whole town had turned out there was some sort of a rally going on i go closer and hear exclamations appeals i heard both anti armenian and anti soviet appeals we don t need perestroika we want to go on living like we have been now what did they mean by living like we have been the azerbaijanis work like everyone else but too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others speculation theft and cheating go on all the time and not just in azerbaijan everywhere in all the republics but i ve never seen it anywhere else like i have in azerbaijan now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the armenians apartments and drive them out beat them and drive them out true i didn t hear them say kill them over the microphone i only heard beat them and drive them out i stayed at the square a few minutes longer first one then another are going up onto the stage and no one tries to stop the crowd off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people and i think they were mvd ministry of internal affairs or state security kgb there were also uniformed policemen there but i didn t see any of them try to pacify the crowd new people kept coming up onto the stage well i had finally decided that this could end badly this was no demonstration and i had to protect my family i left the square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck it was next to the city party committee on narimanov street it stood next to the tai lor s shop there a low truck and it had low wooden panels i see that some thing is being unloaded crates of some sort i decided to go look because after all those appeals i was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there they pulled the crates out onto the square not toward the city party committee but toward the sk club and when i went right up to them i saw that they were cases of vodka there were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck and on the ground there were many people to they were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people two people one case of vodka and there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps maybe about the size of a fist maybe a little bigger or smaller it was anasha when i passed next to that person he stood with his side to me there was about a yard and a half between us and two people were standing near him he has a package in his hand and he s pulling out anasha and handing it out i have never smoked it myself once i tried it for fun but i ve seen a lot of people smoke it i ve seen it many times and i know what it is i strolled around and no one asked me who i was or what i was doing there before i got to the glass bazaar i heard more howling more warlike shouting i turned around and saw them running well i ll just keep on going like i am i thought when they caught up with me i saw that they were carrying flags and i recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street he s a young guy or years old he was carrying a red flag which had ermeni oryum written on it in azerbaijani that means death to armenians that guy used to live off the same courtyard as us i don t really know what his name is but i know his father very well his father s name is rafik he used to be a cook and then became head chef he used to have a dark blue zhiguli van then he sold it and now he has a white zhiguli his family as i said lived on the same courtyard as we did our building was on narimanov street and theirs was on the street of the baku commissars their apartment was in the far entryway on the fifth floor the door on the left now rafik s little brother lives there and he rafik i heard got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict in a word his son was carrying a flag that said death to armenians i was surprised because before this i had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from sumgait but by azerbaijanis from agdam and kafan well anyway i went home my wife was upset i told her it s ok it ll pass they re young kids they ve just gotten all whooped up naturally i didn t want her to get overly upset after a while a new surge of crowd went by and this time they were breaking glass i could hear it breaking but i couldn t see where well i think here we go the machine s in motion they weren t handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing i didn t see people drinking and smoking on the spot but they certainly hadn t unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window so the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running no one would stop them now they weren t even trying although i ll say it again the police were there i saw them and it s not just that the police weren t breaking them up they were joking with them they were having a good time true at the time i couldn t even imagine that under our government our much vaunted leadership and i m not afraid to say these words so many people died so many women were abused and how many abominations there were i couldn t imagine that under our much vaunted authorities and if i were to be specific i would say under the much touted authorities in our city of sumgait i couldn t imagine that such things could take place when they started breaking glass i told my wife and son let s go upstairs we went to our neighbors the grigorians on the fourth floor and in the evening when those crowds started going past again i went outside once more i stopped at the corner a place called that right next to the bazaar i look and see a crowd on the run and there a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar are three respectable looking men of around say years old the crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar and then the whole crowd as though it were one person wheeled and raced toward the bazaar and not a soul went past those three as though it were off limits well everything got all churned up there was more noise and the glass was flying again we spent the night at the neighbors my apartment was on the first floor there was really no way to defend yourself there in the morning i went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town on the way i saw someone hunched up still i never found out who it was or what happened to him there were to people standing near him i got the bread and on my way back they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up sort of enclosing him because of the way they were standing you couldn t even see him that was on the morning of february everyone knows the rest may yerevan reference the

talk.politics.mideast	symbiotics zionism antisemitism from center for policy research cpr subject symbiotics zionism antisemitism zionism and the holocaust by haim bresheeth the first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the holocaust by zionist propaganda is that zionism without anti semitism is impossible zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti semitism namely that jews cannot live with non jews the history and roots of the holocaust go back a long way while the industru of death and destruction did not operate before its roots were firmly placed in the th century jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in europe when the hopes for liberation through bourgeois democratic change were dashed other alternatives for improving the lot of the jews of europe achieved prominence the socialist bund a mass movement with enormous following had to contend with opposition from a new and small almost insignificant opponent the political zionists in outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for jews in europe while the bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of europe s workers the zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding europe of its jews by setting up some form of a jewish state historically nothing is inevitable all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle history can be seen as an option tree every time a certain option is chosen other routes become barred because of that choice movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible while zionism as an option was taken by many young jews it remained a minority position until the first days of the rd reich the zionist federation of germany zvfd an organisation representing a tiny minority of german jews was selected by the nazis as the body to represent the jews of the reich its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in berlin and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period from a marginal position the leaders of the zionist federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them all of a sudden they attained political power power based not on representation but from being selected as the choice of the nazi regime for dealing with the the jewish problem their position in negotiating with the nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the jews in germany transformed them from a utopian marginal organisation in germany and some other countries in europe into a real option to be considered by german jews the best example of this was the transfer agreement of immediately after the nazi takeover in jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of german goods this campaign hurt the nazi regime and the german authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott it was clear that if jews and jewish organisations were to pull out the campaign would collapse this problem was solved by the zvfd a letter sent to the nazi party as early as june outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race nation and the nature of the jewish problem and it offered to collaborate with the new regime the realisation of zionism could only be hurt by resentment of jews abroad against the german development boycott propaganda such as is currently being carried out against germany in many ways is in essence unzionist because zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build in their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime the zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott the main public act was the signature of the transfer agreement with the nazi authorities during the zionist congress of in essence the agreement was designed to get germany s jews out of the country and into mandate palestine it provided a possibility for jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country through a transfer of german goods to palestine this right was denied to jews leaving to any other destination the zionist organisation was the acting agent through its financial organisations this agreement operated on a number of fronts helping jews to leave the country breaking the ring of the boycott exporting german goods in large quantities to palestine and last but not least enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies the jews after all they argued the jews do not belong in europe and now the jews come and agree with them after news of the agreement broke the boycott was doomed if the zionist organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the nazis and import their goods who could argue for a boycott this was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the german public as complementary baron von mildenstein the first head of the jewish department of the ss later followed by eichmann was invited to travel to palestine this he did in early in the company of a zionist leader kurt tuchler having spent six months in palestine he wrote a series of favourable articles in der sturmer describing the new jew of zionism a jew nazis could accept and understand this little known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of nazism between the new regime and the zvfd a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances even after the nature of the final solution became clear in many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations a book concentrating on this aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust is post ugandan zionism in the crucible of the holocaust by s b beth zvi in the case of the kastner episode around which jim allen s play perdition is based even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist it occured near the end of the war the ussr had advanced almost up to germany italy and the african bases had been lost the nazis were on the run with a number of key countries such as rumania leaving the axis a second front was a matter of months away as the western allies prepared their forces in the midst of all this we find eichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder setting up his hz in occupied budapest after the german takeover of the country in april his first act was to have a conference with the jewish leadership and to appoint zionist federation members headed by kastner as the agent and clearing house for all jews and their relationship with the ss and the nazr authorities why they did this is not difficult to see as opposed to poland where its three and a half million jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the polish population the hungarian jews were an integrated part of the community the middle class was mainly jewish the jews were mainly middle class they enjoyed freedom of travel served in the hungarian fascist army in fronline units as officers and soldiers their names were hungarian how was eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated the task was not easy there were a million jews in hungary most of them resident the rest being refugees from other countries many had heard about the fate of jews elsewhere and were unlikely to believe any statements by nazi officials like elsewhere the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened jewish population were the judenrat in this case the judenrat comprsied mainly the zionist federation members without their help the ss with officers and less than men plus a few hundred hungarian police could not have collected and controlled a million jews when they did not even know their whereabouts kastner and the others were left under no illusions eichmann told joel brand one of the members of kastner s committee that he intended to send all hungary s jews to auschwitz before he even started the expulsions he told them clearly that all these jews will die a day unless certain conditions were met the committee faced a simple choice to tell the jews of hungary about their fate with neutral rumania where many could escape being in most cases a few hours away or to collaborate with the nazis by assisting in the concentration process what would not have been believed when coming from the ss sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the zionist leadership thus it is that most of the hungarian jews went quietly to their death assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps to be sure there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction the trains of prominents which eichmann promised to kastner a promise he kept to the last detail for eichmann it was a bargain allowing jews to survive as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million jews there was no way in which the jews of hungary could even be located not to say murdered without the full collaboration of kastner and his few friends no doubt the ss would hunt a few jews here and there but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in auschwitz it is important to realise that kastner was not an aberration like say rumkovsky in lodz kastner acted as a result of his strongly held zionist convictions his actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions this is instanced when he exposed to the gestapo the existence of a british cell of saboteurs palgi and senesh and persuaded them to give themselves up so as not to disrupt his operations at no point during his trial or elsewhere did kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those jews to conclude the role played by zionists in this period was connected to another role they could and should have played that of alarming the whole world to what was happening in europe they had the information but politically it was contrary to their priorities the priorities were and still are quite simple all that furthers the zionist enterprise in palestine is followed whatever the price the lives of individuals jews and non jews are secondary if this process requires dealing with fascists nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world so be it

talk.politics.mideast	more on adl spying case los angeles times tuesday april p a new details of extensive adl spy operation emerge inquiry transcripts reveal nearly years of espionage by a man who infiltrated political groups by richard c paddock times staff writer san francisco to the outside world roy bullock was a small time art dealer who operated from his house in the castro district in reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the anti defamation league for nearly years his code name at the prominent jewish organization was cal and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an arab american delegation that visited rep nancy pelosi d san francisco in her washington d c office for a time cal tapped into the phone message system of the white aryan resistance to learn of hate crimes from police sources he obtained privileged personal information on at least people and he met surreptitiously with agents of the south african government to trade his knowledge for crisp new bills these are among the secrets that bullock and david gurvitz a former los angeles based operative divulged in extensive interviews with police and the fbi in a growing scandal over the nation wide intelligence network operated by the anti defamation league officials of the anti defamation league while denying any improper activity have said they will cooperate with the investigation they have refused to discuss bullock and gurvitz transcripts of the interviews among nearly pages of documents released by san francisco prosecutors last week offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory at times the intelligence activities took on a cloak and dagger air with laundered payments shredded documents hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like ironsides and flipper on one occasion gurvitz recounts he received a tip that a pro palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for haifa israel although the anti defamation league publicly denies any ties to israel gurvitz phoned an israeli consular official to warn him shortly afterward another official called gurvitz back and debriefed him the court papers also added to the mystery of tom gerard a former cia agent and san francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the anti defamation league gerard fled to the philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the fbi but left behind a briefcase in his police locker its contents included passports driver s licenses and identification cards in different names identification cards in his own name for four american embassies in central america and a collection of blank birth certificates army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads a black hood apparently for use in interrogations and photos of blindfolded and chained men investigators suspect that gerard and other police sources gave the adl confidential driver s license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people including as many as members of one target group the arab american anti discrimination committee each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony san francisco police inspector ron roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant the anti defamation league a self described jewish defense and civil rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti semitic extremist or racist the adl s fact finding division headed by irwinn suall in new york enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists however evidence seized from bullock s computer shows he kept files on at least groups of all political stripes including the american civil liberties union earth island institute the united farm workers jews for jesus mother jones magazine the center for investigative reporting the bo gritz for president committee the asian law caucus and the aids activist group act up the computer files also included information on several members of congress including pelosi house armed services committee chairman ron dellums d berkeley and former republican rep pete mccloskey from the bay area in their statements bullock and gurvitz said the anti defamation league has collected information on political activists in the los angeles area for more than years they said they worked closely with three los angeles county sheriff s deputies who specialized in intelligence work a los angeles police department anti terrorism expert and a san diego county sheriff s department intelligence officer a spokesman for the los angeles sheriff s department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the adl the los angeles police department which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation and the san diego sheriff s department declined comment bullock is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama although he is not jewish he began working undercover as a volunteer for the adl and the fbi in indiana in after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the communist party bullock moved to los angeles in and was given a paid position by the adl as an intelligence operative he told authorities in the mid s he moved to san francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the west coast to keep his identity secret his salary has always been funneled through beverly hills attorney bruce i hochman who has never missed a payment in more than years bullock said i was an investigator for the adl i investigated any and all anti democratic movements bullock said officially i m only a contract worker with bruce hochman that way the league would not be officially connected with me bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from communists to arab american to gay radicals to skinheads usually using his own name but once adopting the alias elmer fink i m one of a kind he told police in recent years however his adl affiliation has increasingly become known and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him in the mid s he helped san francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist cory phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police in part because of this investigation he became close friends with gerard who at the time was working in the san francisco police intelligence division bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups an fbi report noted how he investigated one palestinian group bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash and would share the reports with gerard bullock also gave the trash to gerard for gerard to examine gerard would later return the trash to bullock from a wide range of sources bullock compiled files on individuals and more than political groups gerard whose files contained many identical entries kept files on people in bullock and gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the south african government bullock tells of meetings secretly with south african agents at san francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new bills bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources once he rewrote an innocuous item published by san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen about south african bishop desmond tutu and the wife of prominent attorney melvin belli and submitted it as his own work bullock said it was gerard who sold official police intelligence bullock said he split about from the south african government evenly with gerard telling him at one point i may be gay but i m a straight arrow in his interviews with the police and fbi bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law for example bullock admitted to receiving driver s license records and criminal histories from gerard on about people a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer and he said gerard gave him complete san francisco police department intelligence files on various nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy bullock said he also received a confidential fbi report on the nation of islam that he later shredded at the anti defamation league s san francisco office bullock seemed proud of his operation eavesdrop in which he used a paid informant code named scumbag to help tap into a white aryan resistance phone message network listening to the messages left by members of the right wing group for a short time it was wonderful he told police in los angeles adl operative gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a fact finder to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups among other things he told san francisco authorities the los angeles adl office kept a record of any arab american who had anti israel leanings or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the adl intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job gurvitz wanted at the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust studies gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a jewish spy to a right wing hate group gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the fbi in the probe providing considerable information about the adl operation unlike bullock he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation

in israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets apart from mordechai vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors there was one other espionage case the nutty professor at the nes ziona biological institute who was a k g b mole who was tried in camera i wouldn t exactly call it a state secret the trial was simply tried behind closed doors i hate to disappoint you but the united states has tried a number of espionage cases in camera at issue was not a trial behind closed doors but arrest trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy this was appraently attempted in the case of vanunu and failed it has happened before and there is reason to believe it still goes on read this from ma ariv february possibly publication ban the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public by baruch me iri all those involved in this matter politely refused my request one way or another look the subject is too delicate if i comment on it i will be implicitly admitting that it is true if i mention a specific case even hint at it i might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public more precisely a court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment in israel of citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of this country knowing anything about it not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison for security offenses in complete secrecy in the distant past for example during the days of the lavon ya affair we heard about the third man being in prison but many years have passed since then and what existed then can today no longer be found even in south american countries or in the former communist countries but it appears that this is still possible in israel of the chair of the knesset committee on law the constitution and justice mk david zucker sent a letter on this subject early this week to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor ma ariv has obtained the content of the letter during the past several years a number of israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses in some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment in those cases after being legally convicted the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner asserts mk zucker on the other hand zucker agrees in his letter that there is absolutely no question that it is possible and in some cases it is imperative that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials but even in such cases the court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public however one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person s arrest and on the name of a person sentenced to prison is justified and appropriate in the state of israel the principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison zucker thus decided to turn to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor and request that they consider the question the state of israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment the state of israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret wrote zucker the legal counsel of the civil rights union attorney mordechai shiffman said that we as the civil rights union do not know of any cases of security prisoners citizens of israel who are imprisoned and whose imprisonment cannot be made public this is a situation which if it actually exists is definitely unhealthy just like censorship is an unhealthy matter the union is aware says shiffman of cases where notification of a suspect s arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld i am speaking only of several days i know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney sometimes for the whole first month of arrest that is done because of the great secrecy the suspect himself his family his lawyer or even a journalist can challenge the publication ban in court but there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity the journalist knows nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone is happy attorney yossi arnon an official of the bar claims that given the laws as they exist in israel today a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible nothing is easier the court orders a publication ban and that s that someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it do you find this situation acceptable attorney arnon definitely not we live in a democratic country and such a state of affairs is impermissible i am well aware that publication can be damaging from the standpoint of security but total non publication silence is unacceptable consider the trial of mordechai vanunu at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to years in prison the trial was held behind closed doors nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to it is somehow possible to understand though not to accept the reasons but as i have noted we at least are aware of his imprisonment why is the matter actually that serious can t we trust the discretion of the court attorney arnon the judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them the judges do not have the tools to investigate this gives the government enormous power power which they can misuse and what if there really is a security issue attorney arnon i am a man of the legal system not a security expert democracy stands in opposition to security i believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges without entering into detail we have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused in the case of the rachel heller murder a suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public attorney shiffman on the other hand believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect s arrest or of a convicted criminal s imprisonment a healthy situation definitely not but i am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security a different opinion is expressed by attorney uri shtendal former advisor for arab affairs to prime ministers levi eshkol and golda meir clearly we are speaking of isolated special cases such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public no doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication nevertheless adds shtendal the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles i ve mentioned the authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the prime minister or the security services but with

talk.politics.mideast	legality of the jewish purchase was re israeli expansion lust adam shostack writes sam zbib writes i m surprised that you don t consider the acquisition of land by the jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state as a hostile action leading to war it was for the purpose of establishing a state not an exclusive state if the state was to be exclusive it would not have arab citizens could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of israel right after it was formed and no i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action when someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce it is not a hostile action leading to war no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity palestinians are no exception perhaps you heard about anti trust in the business world since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions basic anti trust law says that while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori clearly the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality being a multi ethnic multi religious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion plus they paid fair market value etc they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy i m not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss as to whether the jews wanted to live in peace maybe however they wanted and still want an exclusively jewish state where jews are in control and jews are the masters of the land living in peace is meaningless unless it means living with someone else as equal for a native arab this does not leave many options oh you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens the arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who they vote for as the jews again adam the devil is in the details i don t want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its ok to return deportes and leave the rest because is a nice number that you can devide by and besides it has an integer square root those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective minority if i were wrong you d have israel recall all the palestinian refugees we re talking millions after all they are civilians huh the people who left did so voluntarily there is no reason for israel to let them in do you actually believe this my experience tells me that every palestinian i knew still keeps the key to his home in palestine besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell so to speak i know none that agrees with you did you sample their opinions i know you don t care just being rethorical israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing israel got no western aid in nor in or it still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained and how is granting citizenship a facade don t get me wrong i beleive that israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group jews israel probably had a few options after ethnic cleansing serbian style and deserve the wrath of the international community or make the best out of a no win condition show the world how good israel is towards the bad arabs personaly i ve never heard anything about the arab community in isreal except that they re there so yes they re there but as a community with history and roots its dead tell me something sam what makes land arab how shall i explain its a contract between the man and the land control isn t it the ottomans ruled years and then left with barely a trace the concept of land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic west it is partly the concept of le sol natal native soil i know that jews had previous history in the region but none in recent memory i m talking everyday life not archeology try again you tell me what its isn t but you fail to establish what it is also jews did have history in israel for over a thousand years there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly jews were a majority in jerusalem from or so onwards does that make the land jewish i stand corrected i meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in palestine in recent history i have no problem with jerusalem having a jewish character if it were predominantly jewish so there

talk.politics.mideast	re was go hezbollah in article apr ncsu edu hernlem chess ncsu edu brad hernlem writes in article bce news service uci edu tclock orion oac uci edu tim clock writes are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover assuming also come on brad if we are going to get anywhere in this or any discussion it doesn t help to bring up elements i never addressed nor commented on in any way i made no comment on who is right or who is wrong only that civilians are being used as cover and that having been placed in between the israelis and the guerillas they will be injured as both parties continue their fight the purpose of an army s use of military uniforms is to set its members apart from the civilians so that civilians will not be thought of by the other side as combatants so what do you think is the meaning behind the intention and the effect when an army purposely does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to look like civilians they are judging that the benefit they will receive from this cover is more important that the harm that will come to civilians this is a comment on the israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas do have some responsibility in putting civilians in the middle of this fight by putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians barracks etc the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians but if the guerillas do this aren t they putting themselves at greater risk absolutely they ask themselves why set ourselves apart by wearing uniforms when there is a ready made cover for us civilians that makes sense from their point of view but when this cover is used the guerillas should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back getting even it doesn t make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians i agree with you here i have always thought that israel s bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective but there is no reason that israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks as i said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after the attackers had entered israeli territory it didn t work very well the host arab state did little nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti israel guerillas in residence if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks this is just another selectively applied statement the reason for this drawn out impasse between ababs palestinians and israelis is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other by your criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations that is precisely why the palestinians in their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already they do not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow palestinians to reach full autonomy do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians if you do then why should israel s view of arabs palestinians be any different why should they trust the arab palestinians words since they don t they are very reluctant to give up tangible assets land control of areas in exchange for words for this reason they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached but don t you see that the same statement can be made both ways if lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy absolutely so are the arabs palestinians asking first for the israelis word in relation to any agreement no what is being demanded first is land when the issue is land and one party finally gets hold of this land what the other party does is totally irrelevent if i now have possession of this land your words have absolutely no power whether israel chooses to keeps its word does not get the land back afterall israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in lebanon during slg tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed to cross border attacks still remain to some extent rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life yours of that of others such attacks also continue of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn t make the lebanese so mad as to do that bat guano the situation you call for existed in the s and attacks were commonplace furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible there is no way these groups can be effectively disarmed unless the state is as authoritarian is syria s the only other way is for lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel essentially mirroring israel s border secirity on its side it has to prove to isreal that it is this committed to protecting israel from attack from lebanese territory once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border not lately eh that s what i said ok but doesn t that mean that syria has to take over lebanon i don t think israel or lebanon would like that what both sides need is to receive something tangible the arabs palestinians are looking for land and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to israel israel has two problems if it gives up real land it is exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation and that change doesn t help israel s position and when it gives up this land it needs to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks tim

talk.politics.mideast	the hamas way of death the hamas way of death following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the qassam battalions the military arm of hamas an islamic palestinian group hamas figures significantly in the middle east equation in december israel deported more than palestinians to lebanon in response to hamas s kidnapping and execution of an israeli soldier a longer version appears in the may issue of harper s magazine which obtained and translated the tape my name is yasir hammad al hassan ali i live in nuseirat a refugee camp in the gaza strip i was born in i finished high school then attended gaza polytechnic later i went to work for islamic university in gaza as a clerk i m married and i have two daughters the qassam battalions are the only group in palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad holy war our primary concern is palestinians who collaborate with the enemy many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the israeli security services since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration to do so we abduct collaborators intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure palestinians into collaboration in the first place in addition to that naturally we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them we don t execute every collaborator after all about percent of them are innocent victims tricked or black mailed into their misdeeds the decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes if like many collaborators he has been recruited as an agent of the israeli border guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once he s as dangerous as an israeli soldier so we treat him like an israeli soldier there s another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators i regard the isqat the process by which a palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator if someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat than it is our religious duty to execute him a third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics they work on direct orders from the security services to distribute drugs as widely as possible their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more they collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave the dealers must also be executed in the battalions we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators we can t afford to abduct an innocent person because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established never before if after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt then he is executed in many cases we don t have to make our evidence against collaborators public because everyone knows that they re guilty but when the public isn t aware that a certain individual is a collaborator and we accuse him people are bound to ask for evidence many people will proclaim his innocence so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed this proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession at first every collaborator denies his crimes so we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him we tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people even in the last moment of his life by confessing and giving us the information we need we say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim that kind of talk is convincing most of them confess after that others hold out in those cases we apply pressure both psychological and physical then the holdouts confess as well only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation in that case the collaborator had been seen working for the border guard since before the intifada and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend who disclosed the information to us in addition three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat with this much evidence there was no need to interrogate him but we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions in every case our principal is the same the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes a few weeks ago we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation an although we had hundreds of names still because of our fear of god and of hell we could not mark any of these men except for the one i just mentioned for execution when we execute a collaborator in public we use a gun but after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator we can t shoot him to do so might give away our locations that s why collaborators are strangled sometimes we ask the collaborator what do you think how should we execute you one collaborator told us strangle me he hated the sight of blood naftaly

madness from the israeli press paper zman tel aviv tel aviv s time friday local tel aviv s paper affiliated with maariv date february journalist guy ehrlich subject interview with soldiers who served in the duvdevan cherry units which disguise themselves as arabs and operate within the occupied territories excerpts from the article a lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods but the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with it is that everyone who serves in the cherry after a time goes in one way or another insane a man who said this who will here be called danny his full name is known to the editors served in the cherry after his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy his pal who will here be called dudu was also serving in the cherry and is now about to depart for a round the world tour they both look no different from average israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service but in their souls one can notice something completely different it was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them and they think that to most of their fellows from the cherry it woundn t be easy either yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking the following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry we called such soldiers h i hit by the intifada under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non stop which is a common phenomenon in the cherry i sent him to a psychiatrist but why i should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane on fridays when i come home my parents know i cannot be talked to until i go to the beach surf a little calm down and return the keys of my father s car must be ready for in advance so that i can go there i they dare talk to me before or whenever i don t want them to talk to me i just grab a chair and smash it instantly i know it is my nerve smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home to the car and to the beach only there i become normal another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother it was an omelette of sorts she took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me i then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind i told her how i shot an arab and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it she began to laugh hysterically i wanted her to cry and she dared laugh straight in my face instead so i told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov cocktails he shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as they deserved one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire with the effect that the arab was burning all over just beautifully i was delighted to see it my pal fired three bullets two at the arab with the molotov cocktail and the third at his chum it hit him straight in his ass we both felt that we d pulled off something next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look i reached the spot first and then that arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at me i yelled shut up and he dared talk back to me in hebrew so i just laughed straight in his face i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes then i told him all right wait a moment i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that i keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my face this infuriated me i got very angry because i felt i was becoming mad so i stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her head only then she stopped laughing at first she didn t know what to say but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field a gull appeared right in the middle of the field my friend shot it at once then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock we shot down two deer more and went to take a look when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother we carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit we were just delighted by that sight we had hit em so good then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further suffering i approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of prey we couldn t explain what had happened to us we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly we always go back to places we carried out assignments in this is why we can see them when you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you got power you feel godlike of sorts both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting dudu is not willing to work in any security linked occupation danny feels the exact opposite why shouldn t i take advantage of the skills i have mastered so well why shouldn t i earn for each chopped head i would

ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the gazans your comparison with the warsaw ghetto uprising is insulting and racist beyond belief the attempts to quiet any violence in the gaza strip are just that the efforts to quell murder and mayhem in the gaza strip were the resluts of violence and came after the violence it was not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of jews jews had not committed acts of violence and murder as have the residents of gaza i find your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than anti israel bigotry the gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of gaza some people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in israel it is not punishment but protection from repeated attacks by residents of gaza you self servingly omit any references to why israel has had to take action apparaently the deaths of innocent israeli civilians do not enter into your equation a racist ommission on your part while polish non jews risked their lives to save jews from the ghetto no israeli jew is known to have risked his life to help the gazan resistance the only help given to gazans by israeli jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance the right of the gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice a population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors the right of israel to protect its citizens from murderers is also recognized by international law israeli civilians have been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis if this wave of murder does not matter to you then your posturing for the basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing but an anti israel charade as is known the israeli regime is considering gazans unworthy of israeli citizenship and equal rights in israel although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in israeli hotels shops and fields do you know of residents of gaza who have applied for israeli citizenship and were denied i have heard of no such denials taking place can you document this or is this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda the truth is that if gazan residents applied for citizenship hamas would murder them as collaborators many gazans are born in towns and villages located in israel they may not live there for these areas are reserved for the master race how dare you use such a disgusting phrase how very easy you attack a people when you omit facts which fly in the face of your pure racism perhaps you are judging a people to be the racists that you are do you believe that all jews must have the same bigoted makeup as you here s another little fly in your ointment about the master race for you to avoid two months ago a plane with bosnian muslims left bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east four arab nations refused to grant them asylum then when israli arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them they were allowed into israel yes israel but when the plane landed the israeli arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project because they felt that it would make israel look good it was more important to avoid any good pr for israel than to take care of fellow muslims israel moved them to a kibbutz where they are safe and secure the truth is that time after time the islamic world has turned its back on muslims in need more than israel has even in the case of the deportees lebanon was willing to let their so called arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in lebanon nearly twice as many palestinians have been murdered by other palestinians than in confrontations with israel hundreds of thousands of palestinians had been deported from kuwait just because they were palestinian the truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack israel you are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the palestinians to attacking israel but the truth is there are greater reasons than israel for the plight of the palestinians to disregard jordan or kuwait or saudi arabia or any of the other oil rich nations who do nothing for these people is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of jews or your hatred of israel anti semitism and anti zionism is not the same as pro palestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare the nazi regime accorded to the residents of the warsaw ghetto the right to self administration they selected jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance some jewish collaborators were killed israel also wishes to rule over gaza through arab collaborators your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism cannot be disguised jews had never declared war on a polish people jews had never attacked poles with knives or had used the ghetto as a staging ground for attacks to take something like the warsaw ghetto the creation of which you do not even bother to discuss and the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview you clearly have never even read a single word of the covenant of the islamic resistance movement here is arguably the single most anti semitic genocidal document since mein kampf yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation if it were considered you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner rather than in an anti semitic manner as israel denies gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self determination it must be concluded that the israeli jewish society does not consider gazans full human beings and just how was gaza obtained do you forget that israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it but had taken gaza in a war that it did not start did you know land israel captures in wars wars which other nations have always started aren t the same as israel and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws since you do continuously refer to international law would you please say what specific international laws israel is violating this attitude is consistent with the attitude of the nazis towards jews i can cite reasons why it is not the current policies by the israeli government of cutting off gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by prime mininister yitzhak rabin that gaza sink into the sea where is this quote i have never heard rabin assert that he wished such a thing since you are in general a liar you ll have to provide the entire quote with source or this effort will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications one is led to ask oneself whether israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the gazans whether they have some final solution up their sleeve only you are led to ask such a loaded racist intellectually dishonest question you inability to come to terms with what you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order i urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the gazans regain their full human civil and political rights to which they are entitled as human beings why do you not feel the same compassion for the jews of iran or iraq or yemen or saudi arabia or syria do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades or what about the plight of the palestinians in kuwait or what about the treatment of the bosnian muslims do you think the residents of gaza are being subjected to what all the muslims in bosnia are enduring why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated why do you not care that only israel has given any of these people safe haven could it be due to the fact that it is not israel who is doing the killing the people in gaza are not being exterminated they aren t being killed they aren t being raped they aren t being starved they aren t being driven from their lands they are not kept from receiving food or other supplies but the bosnians are and the only country which has provided some sanctuary to the bosnian muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking in the guise of compassion your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you in your case it is clear that hate beats out love every time maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a jew it is obvious that your hatred of your own judaism is being dumped on all other jews why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding jews out of existence maybe these fits of anti semitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period whatever the case may be it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be when you realize that you can t care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good but for now you are a fruad

balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank that s a good block and a half or two from here i know this for sure because i saw it myself deposition of tatyana mikhailovna arutunian nezhintseva born train conductor azerbaijani railroad resident at building apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan i hadn t lived very long in sumgait only eight years i moved there from novosibirsk my son entered the baku nautical school and so i transferred to azerbaijan later i met someone and married him and now my name is arutunian my husband s name that there would be a massacre was not discussed openly but there were hints and gibes so to speak at the armenian people and they were mocking the russians too i was constantly aware of it at work and not just this past year i couldn t find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because i i ll just say it couldn t steal couldn t deceive and couldn t be involved in bribe taking and when i asked for decent working conditions they told me leave don t keep the others from working you aren t cut out for this kind of work and at work and around all the time i would hear gibes at the armenians like the turks had it right they killed them all the way they ve multiplied here they re making it hard for us to live and things will be just fine if we get rid of them all no problem the turks will help they say if we ask them they ll rid armenia of armenians in half an hour well that s the way it all was but i never thought of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy because you just couldn t imagine it here we ve been living under the soviet government for years and no one even considered such an idea possible but i had been forming my own opinions and in the presence of authoritative people i would often ask where is this all leading do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here the russians are fleeing sumgait there are very few of them left why is no one dealing with this what s going on and when it all happened on the th and th it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone because what else are you to make of it if the first secretary of the city party committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an azerbaijani flag i wouldn t be saying this now if i hadn t received personal confirmation from him later because when we were under guard in the sk club on the st he came to the club that muslimzade the women told me there he is there he is that s muslimzade i didn t believe the rumors that he had carried an azerbaijani flag i thought that they were just false rumors i went over to him and said are you the first secretary of our city party committee he answers me yes and i ask him tell me did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an azerbaijani flag and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs i don t know exactly what they said but there was mention of armenian blood and he tells me yes i was there but i tried to dissuade them from it then i asked him another question and where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us and he said i we didn t know what to do we didn t know we didn t anticipate that that would happen in sumgait comrade mamedov the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr answered the same question for me no we actually didn t anticipate the slaughter in sumgait at that time we were trying to contain the crowd of in baku that was preparing for a massacre those are his exact words the ones he said in the office of the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and now about the events themselves of course it s painful to discuss them because it may seem that it s not true to someone else various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds some are true others aren t but unfortunately there are more true ones than false because it was so horrible in our age here in the space age the age of science the age of progress i don t know if someone had told me this story if i were living in or around moscow i wouldn t have believed it why not because it was really a genocide it was a massacre that s genuinely what it was for example on that day the th i didn t know about the th because my husband and i were both sick both of us had the flu and we were in bed on the th our neighbor comes to our place and says you re in bed you don t know anything about it there was a demonstration in town and after it they were overturning armenian cars and burning them they were looking into cars and asking are you an armenian if they answered in armenian then they turned the car over and burned it this isn t made up the wife of the senior investigator of the baku ministry of internal affairs told us he was returning home from his dacha with his wife raisa sevastyanova she s my neighbor she immediately came and told lis that they had landed right in the middle of it i don t know what to call it the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping he answered in azerbaijani they let them go but they made him honk the horn they were kicking up a fracas we didn t even believe it and i said certainly that didn t happen how can that be and she said muslimzade was leading the crowd and the sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are armenians and when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store he said don t break the shop windows don t destroy state property but do whatever else you want i didn t hear this with my own two ears but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing armenians although he s an azerbaijani while we were talking all of a sudden right across from us sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say look there s a crowd out there and sure enough when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building there was an armenian family there a woman and two girls they lived across from us i m sorry i don t know the building number or the people s names since we were in my husband s apartment in microdistrict and i lived in microdistrict no there was awful looting going on there at the time the most hideous things were going on there then one building there ours was attacked twice once wasn t enough for them they returned to the places where they hadn t finished the armenians off if an azerbaijani family dared to conceal armenians they beat the azerbaijanis too they also beat russians if it was russians doing the hiding because there were russians among them they said so on television there were people of various nationalities but they didn t tell us why there were people of different nationalities because they wouldn t have touched the azerbaijanis if they hadn t dared to stick up for the armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes at the time i saw this from the window i was there sevastyanova was there and so was my husband we went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony all kinds of things even a sofa then when it was all down there they burned it up then we saw the crowd and they were all oohing at first i couldn t figure out what was happening and later i told my husband lendrush l think they re beating someone out there and he answered i don t know could be suddenly the crowd separated for a moment and i saw it and raisa sevastyanova saw it too my husband had turned the other way he didn t see it i saw a naked girl with her hair down they were dragging her she kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her she fell down it was muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank that s a good block and a half or two from here i know this for sure because i saw it myself then the crowd rushed toward our building we were standing there and you can of course imagine what we were feeling were they going to kill us or not and i also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman because i had just seen that i asked my husband i gave him an axe and said you kill me first and then let them do what they want with the corpse but our neighbors it s true defended us they said there aren t any armenians in our entryway go away only muslims live here disaster missed us that time but at two o clock in the morning a crowd of about people approximately came back to our place my husband was already asleep he can sleep when he s upset about something but i can t i was standing running from balcony to balcony our power was out i don t remember for how long but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off there were no lights whatsoever and i was glad of course i thought it was better that way but then i look and the crowd is at our balcony this was at in the morning the first time they were at our building it was and now it was in the morning but i never thought that that old woman on the first floor the azerbaijani was awake and watching out there were human beings among them too so she goes out with a pail of garbage as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o clock in the morning she used it as a pretext and went toward those young people they really were youngsters from my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young azerbaijani boys they spoke azerbaijani and when they came up to her she said what do you want and they answered we want the armenian family that lives here pointing toward the second floor with their hands she says i already told you we don t have any armenians here now leave do you hear this is an old muslim woman talking to you and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away and so they seemed to listen to her they were all very young they started apologizing and left that was the second time death was at our door i forgot to mention about one other apartment a man named rubik lives there i don t know him really i knew his daughter i mean i saw her around but we really didn t know them but i do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to chernobyl and worked there for eight months to earn money can you imagine what that means he risked his life to earn x amount of money in order to better his family he bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughter s hand in marriage but alas everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels they threw everything out the windows and the rest we saw from our balcony how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadn t already been smashed or taken what is one to think of that it means that the parents in those families were in on it too unfortunately i came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance both the beating of the armenians and the stripping of apartments something on the order of we ll move the armenians out and take over their apartments i have worked honestly my whole life you can check everything about me i came as a patriot from china waited for nights on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr i came to my homeland as a patriot because i knew that the party and the komsomol were holy things but when i saw in sumgait that there wasn t anything holy about them that party membership was bought that komsomol members joined only for personal gain that there were no ideals no ideas god save me everything was being bought and sold i saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did i can t talk any more about it the image of that beating when i went out of my own apartment they picked us up under soviet army guard they had arrived from all over to suppress that gang not only armenians but some russian families and their children too came out of their apartments and joined us because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was and what s interesting is that when we left on the buses i rode and thought that at least one group of people for sure people would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for the armenians would somehow understand the injustice of what was done but having analyzed and weighed the whole thing once i calmed down having thought it all through i came to a conclusion that is shared by many people if a lot of azerbaijanis didn t want their armenian neighbors to be killed and that basically depended on that muslimzade he said that he had wanted to calm them down then is it possible that he didn t have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute go and announce it on television citizens of sumgait take what you can into your hands let s protect our neighbors from this massacre those crowds weren t such that there was no controlling them basically they were unarmed they didn t have firearms mostly they had knives they had all kinds of metal parts like armature shafts sharpened at the ends special rocks different to a degree that we noticed them there aren t rocks like those in sumgait soils they were brought from somewhere as though it were all specially planned so as i was saying i weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us why wasn t it arranged it means that the government didn t want to do it when the crowd was moving from the city party committee to the sputnik what there was no way of informing baku no there was no way it turns out the crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict i won t mention the things i didn t see myself i ll only talk about the things i myself witnessed they were in microdistrict beginning at o clock in the evening when i saw them from the other building and they were somewhere else until mid night or one o clock in the morning because at they came back to our building they hadn t completely finished making their predatory rounds of microdistrict when they returned to our building i told my husband lendrush now the police are probably going to come my god now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid well alas no there were to be no authorities not a single policeman not a single fireman not a single ambulance came while they were raging as it turns out as we later found out beginning on the might of the th there were dead people ruined apartments and burned autos one car near the bus station it was burned and overturned it was probably there about four days everyone saw it and what went on in block those who live there know they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses how they beat those poor unarmed soldiers and how on that square i can t remember the name of it where there is that fork coming from the bus station that intersection now i m upset and i can t think of the name there s a tall building there a story and from the balconies there people saw that butchery when the poor soldiers wearing only helmets with shields and those unfortunate clubs moved against that mob and when they fell those to year old boys ran up and using stones big heavy stones beat them to death on their heads who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government the upshot is that this republic has not been under soviet control for a long time but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved if you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that i tell the truth i ve been struggling for truth for five years there already the five years that i worked at the azerbaijani railroad some people there considered me a demagogue others who knows what some think i m an adventure seeker and some a prankster but i wanted everything to be right i would become outraged how can this be why is it people treat one another this way on a soviet railroad as though the azerbaijani railroad were azerbaijani property or the property of some magnate or some mafia if i want to i ll get you out of here if i want to i ll get rid of you if i want to i ll do something else and there s a black market price for everything in the most brazen way a coach to moscow costs so much a coach on a local train costs so much once when i was complaining to the head of the conductor s pool he had the nerve to tell me maybe you won t even believe this but this i m afraid i heard with my own ears tatyana just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect you re alone against everyone so instead why don t you give more money to the chief conductor and everything will go fine for you i started to cry turned and left what else could i do where else could i go to complain i realized that everything was useless and the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it i filed a written complaint and they ground it into dust they destroyed it i still have a copy but what s the use when the general procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody sumgait affair in addition to the information about what i saw what i was a witness to i gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad they accepted my petition but i don t know if they re going to pursue it or not because you ll excuse me i no longer believe in the things i aspired to the things i believed in before it s all dead they just spit on my soul stomped on everything physically and most important spiritually because you can lose belongings that s nonsense that all comes with time but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you your beliefs are destroyed it can be very difficult to restore them i want to tell of one incident i just don t know at the time i was in such a state that i didn t even take minor things into account here is an example of course it s not a minor one my neighbor raisa sevastyanova she has a son valery who is in the th grade in a school in microdistrict a boy vitaly danielian i don t know his last name goes to school with him or rather went to school with him i was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to moscow oh yes and there s one important detail when the massacre began for two to three hours the phones weren t working in armenian apartments and later in several russian and azerbaijani apartments but the fact of the matter is that service was shut off you could not call anywhere why again it means it was all planned how come service is cut off for no reason and the lights went off and those brats were raging as they liked they weren t afraid they ran about freely they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them they knew it now i m going to tell about the incident so this little vitaly vitalik an armenian boy went to school with valery they were in the same class according to what valery and his neighbor pal said at the time i was in the same apartment as they were i sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put through a mob attacked the building where vitalik lived so valery ran to his mother and said mamma please let me go to vitalik s what if they kill him maybe he s still alive maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow he s a nice guy we all like him he s a good person he s smart his mother wouldn t let him go in tears she says valery you can t go because i am afraid he says mamma we can get around the crowd we ll just watch just have a look they made it through i don t know i think vitalik s parents lived in microdistrict no and when they got there they made a superficial deduction knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere that you could see from the street which were the armenian apartments in the building they went here and there and looked and saw that the windows were intact and so they calmed down but even though the windows in that apartment were not broken everything inside was totally smashed and vitalik lay there with a broken skull and his mother and father had already been murdered little vitalik didn t even know they were dead so two weeks ago i don t know he was in critical condition no maybe it was longer we left sumgait on march spent some time in moscow and then we came to yerevan so it s been about a month already it s so hard to keep all this straight so valery the next day when he found out that vitalik s family has been killed and vitalik was ling in the semashko hospital in baku valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him but they wouldn t admit them telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in a coma they cried and left having also found out that the girl i saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too as it turns out she was brought there in serious condition but at least she was alive at the time when we got to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not if those friends were alive or not and when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived when you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end if you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book a book of things it is even difficult to believe and those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue the ones at the sk they know i m not lying that girlfriend came up to one of them and said what happened and she bared her breasts and they were completely covered in cigarette burns those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts after something like that i don t know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it now when we stayed at the military unit for a while they provided well basic conditions for us there the military unit is located in nasosny some six miles from sumgait and living there we met with a larger group of people there were about people at the unit you know there was a point when i couldn t even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you and when you hear the false rumors yes by the way false rumors were spread in sumgait saying that the armenians around yerevan had destroyed azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers i didn t know whether to believe it or not and people who don t know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge but when i arrived in armenia and was in spitak and in spitak all those villages are not only intact but at that time had even been protected just in case they were guarded they got better food than did the inhabitants of spitak not a single person there died and no one is planning to harm them around yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed and the armenians didn t attack anyone but actually after an evil of the magnitude suffered in sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness but no one acted on it and i don t know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the armenians are guilty that it is they who organized it rumors like that are being spread in azerbaijan and if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it they not only perceive it with their minds but with their hearts too to them it seems that the older person is telling the truth for example one says did you know that out of people killed by the way originally they said people but later they found a nd were azerbaijani and one was an armenian of course i m upset but it s utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset sometimes l forget things but i know i want to return to the time when we were in the sk club across from the city party committee when i saw muslimzade in the sk club building i went to him to ask because i couldn t believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner i already mentioned this and if i repeat anything please excuse me i asked him why did you do that and why are you here now why did you come here to laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor the overcrowding there was tremendous it was completely unsanitary and several of the children were already sick it s true the troops tried to make it livable for us they cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere plus they were never given any direct orders they didn t know what they were authorized to do and not to do and it was only on march at five o clock in the evening that krayev himself the lieutenant general the city commandant of sumgait was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do as his heart advised him and relocate people to the military unit but that s not what i want to talk about now muslimzade characteristically tried to get me out of the sk building and take me to the city party committee which is across the square from the club he took me by the hand and said citizen don t worry we ll go and have a talk in my office i told him no after everything you ve done i don t believe one iota of what you say if i go to the city party committee i ll disappear and the traces of me will disappear too because you can t stand it when oh yes and there was another interesting detail from that meeting it was even very funny although at the time i wasn t up to laughing he was in a nice expensive hat and so as to put him to shame so to speak i said oh why did you come here all duded up like a london dandy you smell of good perfume you re in your starched shirt and you have your expensive hat on you came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor who are already getting sick whose relatives have died did you come to laugh at them and the one who was accompanying him an azerbaijani i don t know who he was or what his title was he quickly snatched the hat off muslimzade s head and hid it then i said my god we re not marauders we re not you we didn t come to you with the intention of stealing well kill me kill me muslimzade says to me but i m not guilty kill me kill me but i m not guilty and i say ok fine you re not guilty have it your way but give us an answer we re asking you where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women when they were killing the children burning things carrying on outrageously and wrecking all those apartments where were you then you know we didn t expect it we did not know what to do we didn t anticipate that something like that would happen in sumgait i started laughing and said it s truly funny he says what could i do we didn t know what to do and i say i m sorry but it ll be ridiculous if i tell you the first secretary of the city party committee shouldn t march out in front with a banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body that s what you should have done that s the way it was during the war not a single party committee secretary compromised himself either he died or he led people into battle and what did you do you ran away you left you hid you marched with a flag because you were afraid excuse my language you feared for your own damned hide and when we ask you you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done that s right i told him the city party committee got confused all the party committees got confused the police got confused baku got confused they all lay in a faint for two weeks and the gang ran the show with impunity and if it weren t for the troops it wouldn t have been just two days there wouldn t be a single armenian left in sumgait for sure they would have finished their bloody affair because they brazenly went up to some russians too the ones who tried to say something to them and they told them as soon as we finish with the armenians we ll come after you too and by the way there was a colonel who took us to the military unit he was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the sk and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit we asked him what how what will come of us he openly said you know for us the main thing now is to catch that gang we ll finish that quickly you ll stay at the military unit for the time being and we ll decide later the general procuracy of the ussr arrived it consists of investigators from all cities there were some from stavropol from everywhere just everywhere because the affair was truly frightful about this by the way comrade katusev spoke as everyone knows he s the first deputy general procurator of the ussr when he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit by the way he told us the honest truth because he couldn t not say it because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen and he said there was afghanistan and it was bad but sumgait it s horrible and the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely punished in accordance with our laws and that s a quote then one mother throws herself at him her two sons had died before her very eyes and says who will return my sons who is going to punish the culprits they tried to calm her down and he said in order for us to conduct a proper investigation in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility you must help us because we don t know maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes and maybe the neighbors know maybe someone saw something don t be afraid write about it in detail so that you re not afraid everyone knows that many of you are afraid having lived through such horrors they think that if they write the whole truth about let s say their neighbor or someone else that they will seek revenge later we re going to do it like this we re going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there we don t need to know who wrote it the names of the people who write won t be made public but we need all the information let each and every one not be afraid let each write what is necessary who they saw in that gang who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the armenians you must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn two soldiers and a major guarded the urn and sure enough many people people who didn t even want to write i know one woman who asked me she came up and said you as a russian the same thing won t happen to you as will happen to me so please i ll give you the information and you please write it down for me so she was afraid and there were a lot like her but later after katusev made his speech she sat and wrote down everything she knew and we threw it all into the urn now we don t know if it will be of any use for a factual picture will emerge from all that information one person can lie but thousands can t lie thousands simply can t lie you have to agree with that a fact is a fact why for example should someone say that black is white if it is really black the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr mamedov as i said was in yerevan my husband and i were at the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov was present the one who had come to convince the people of sumgait to return to their previous dwellings to their old apartments we asked for a meeting with him and it was granted when we went to see him he tried to behave properly very politely delicately but when the truth was told right to his face and when i asked him some of the same questions i had asked muslimzade where were you personally when they were beating us now you re trying to convince us to return why didn t you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading he says you re telling the truth let s not mince words you ve told me right to my face and i ll tell you straight i ll tell you the pure truth i was gotten out of bed in the evening the whole government was up including me and we were restraining a crowd of about in baku but we never expected that in a city like sumgait with its fine international record such a thing could happen we expected it in baku i say so that means you expected it all the same why were you expecting it and he says you know it just happened that way we were expecting it in baku we were trying to restrain it but in sumgait i say fine you didn t know for the first three or four hours but then you should have known why did no one help us and he says well ok we didn t know what to do and things like that basically it was the same story i got from muslimzade later when he said you go on back the situation in sumgait is favorable now everything is fine the armenians are friendly with the azerbaijanis to this l answered you know what i m speaking with you as a member of a neutral nation i have never argued with armenians or with azerbaijanis and i was an eyewitness you tell me please comrade mamedov i asked him what would you say about this honestly if you were being completely frank with us then he said yes i admit that i am honestly ashamed shame on the entire azerbaijani nation we have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire soviet union but before the whole world because now the voice of america and all the other foreign radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors too and i say there s nothing to add to what really happened i don t think it s possible to add anything more awful he says yes i agree with you i understand your pain it is truly an unfortunate occurrence i repeat that he said unfortunate occurrence and then he suddenly remembered himself what he was saying he had a pen in his hands he was fidgeting with it nervously and said oh excuse me a tragedy really i take this to mean that he really thinks it s an unfortunate occurrence and of course he says i understand that having gone through all this you can t return to sumgait but it s necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being tried and he even gave a detail which i don t know if it matters or not that policemen were being tried specifically in relation to that bloody affair yes by the way there is another good detail how i was set up at work in baku after the events i went to an undergarment plant there was an azerbaijani working there and suddenly she tells me what they didn t nail your husband they screwed up i was floored i hadn t imagined that anyone in baku too could say something like that well after that i went up to see to my office i needed to find out about those days what was going to happen with them how they were going to put down those days from february to march and the administrator told me i don t know tatyana go to the head of the conductors pool be grateful if they don t put it down as unexcused absence i was really discouraged by this they all know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived and here they re telling me that i was skipping work as though i was off enjoying myself somewhere i went to the office of the chief of the pool his last name is rasulov and he s had that position for many years incidentally he s a party member and is a big man in town and suddenly when i went to him and said comrade rasulov this is the way it was he looked at me askance and said and why are you he knows me by my previous last name why did you get wrapped up in this mess i say what do you mean why did i get wrapped up in this mess my husband s an armenian i tell him i have an armenian last name and he screwed up his face made a kind of a grimace as though he had eaten something sour and said i didn t expect that you would what did he mean by that and how should he behave the chief of the pool a man who supervises workers now it s true there was a reduction but for sure there are still conductors working for him and if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that then what can you expect from a simple uneducated politically unsophisticated person he s going to believe any and all rumors that the armenians are like this the armenians are like that and so on by the way that mamedov now i m going back to mamedov s office when i asked him are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return to sumgait he answered yes you know i would guarantee them i don t want to take on too much i would guarantee them firmly for years but i won t guarantee them for longer than years i say so you ve got another thing like that planned for years from now so they ll be quiet and then in another years it ll happen again i couldn t contain myself any more and i also told him and how did it get to that point certainly you knew about it how they were treating the russians for example in baku and in sumgait how they were hounded from their jobs certainly you received complaints i wrote some myself why did no one respond to them why did everyone ignore what was going on didn t you prepare people for this by the way you treated them and he says you know you re finally starting to insult me he threw his pen on the desk maybe now you ll say i m a scoundrel too i say you know i m not talking about you because i don t know but about the ones who i do know i can say with conviction yes that comrade was involved in this that and that because i know for certain well anyway he assured us that here in yerevan there were false rumors that sumgait armenians were here and were in sumgait and had gotten back to work everyone was working he said and life was very good we drove about the town ourselves comrade arutiunian first secretary of the communist party of armenia ssr came from the council of ministers of armenian he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in sumgait when i asked mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said well i walked down the street and i said walking down the street in any city even if i were to go to new york i would never understand the situation because i would be a guest i don t have any contact with people but if you spend days among some blue collar workers in such a way that they didn t know you were the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers you d hear something quite different i told him for example that i drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments they took us all in turns to pick things up since people had fled to the military unit they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible how are the neighbors in the microdistrict how will they view us what do they think i thought maybe that in fact it wasn t something general of a mass nature some anti national something and when that bus took us to our building because it was the same bus while we were going up to our apartment an armed soldier accompanied us what does that say it speaks of the fact that if everything there were fine why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us going from apartment to apartment and in fact especially with the young people you could sense the delight at our misfortune the grins and they were making comments too and that was in the presence of troops when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and tanks were passing by and if people are taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that then what is it going to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether there will be more outrages of course perhaps not organized but in the alleys april
